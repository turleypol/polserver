		<h2>About</h2>
	</div>

	<div id="content">
		<p>This package is designed to be an easy drop in package that enables emailing support direct from the server.
			It takes advantages of some core changes to the OpenConnection() function from the OS.em file which were also
			implemented specifically whilst designing this package, so if you are having issues or getting errors, please
			make sure that your core is up to date first.</br><b>Make sure your CORE version is commit 09d5da5 or later(release date 2017-10-22)</b></p>
			
		<p>This package was written for the POL Distro headed by Yukiko and was designed with the intention of reducing and
			documenting any entry or exit points of the package to make custom or sister packages directly replaceable using those same entry and exit points.
			</p>
			
			<p>For basic usage it only requires 2 lines in any other script.
				<ul>
					<li>include ":email:emailer";</li>
					<li>SendEmail( ToEmail, Subject, Body);</li>
					</ul><br/>
					There is additional information that the SendEmail() function can take however that is listed in the include files section.<br/><br/>
					I've also done the best I can(be bothered) to make sure that the src and inc files are as documented as possible. 
					If you don't understand something please don't hesitate to let me know and i can assist you in why I've done something
					a certain way and then maybe document the scripts more.
					</p>
