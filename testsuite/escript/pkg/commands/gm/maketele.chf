To create a portal, perform the following steps:
1. Create a recall rune using the command .create recall rune
2. Go to the destination for one side of the portal. You can use .goxyz <x coordinate>, <y coordinate>, <z coordinate> if you know the x, y, and z coordinates for that location. The z coordinate is optional.
3. Mark the rune using the command .mark
4. Go to the destination for the other side of the portal.
5. Use the command .maketele and target the rune.

A portal will be created at your location and at the location marked on the rune.
