	// SleepTime is the time the script will sleep between
	// vital regeneration checks. The Core performs a regen
	// cycle every 5 seconds. So the default setting for
	// SleepTime is 5. I have made it a config setting for
	// shard developers in the event they want to adjust it
	// for customization and to reduce server load.
	SleepTime		5

	// Point value to use in SkillCheck() call.
	// Value can be as low as 0.
	// If set to 0, the AwardDefault value defined in
