<center>sysinfo</center>The sysinfo command allows developers
to see basic info about the server and
to run limited diagnostics. Currently
it shows the number of mobiles and
items present in the server as well
as various other information and
it allows a developer to view
performance info and create and view
script performance logs.

When the command is run, the Information
page is displayed. Clicking on the
Diagnostic button will display various
data about performance. From this page
a script performance log can be created
and viewed. Click on the Performance
Measure button. Then wait for the Log
to finish being created. You will
receive a green message when it is done.
To view the log click on the View Logs
button. The logs are date and time
stamped using the ISO standard,
yyyymmddThhmmss. Click the button next
to the log you wish to view. The logs
are stored in /logs/performance.

As this is a work-in-progress, only
the Information and Diagnostic buttons
are functional.
