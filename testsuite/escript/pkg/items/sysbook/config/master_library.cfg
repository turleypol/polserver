	title	A Grammar of Orcish
	author	Yorick o' Yew
	p1l1	This volume, and others in 
	p1l2	the series, are sponsored 
	p1l3	by donations from Lord 
	p1l4	Blackthorn, ever a 
	p1l5	supporter of 
	p1l6	understanding the other 
	p1l7	sentient races of 
	p1l8	Britannia
	p2l1	The Orcish tongue may 
	p2l2	fall unpleasingly ‘pon the 
	p2l3	ear, yet it has within it 
	p2l4	a complex grammar oft 
	p2l5	misunderstood by those 
	p2l6	who merely hear the few 
	p2l7	broken words of English 
	p2l8	our orcish brothers 
	p3l1	manage without education.
	p3l2	
	p3l3	These are the basic rules 
	p3l4	of orcish:
	p3l5	
	p3l6	Orcish has five tenses: 
	p3l7	present, past, future 
	p3l8	imperfect, present 
	p4l1	interjectional, and 
	p4l2	prehensile.
	p4l3	Examples: gugroflu, 
	p4l4	gugrofloog, gugrobo, 
	p4l5	gugrolu!, gugrogug.
	p4l6	
	p4l7	All transitive verbs in 
	p4l8	the prehensile tense end 
	p5l1	it “ug.”
	p5l2	Examples: urgleighug, 
	p5l3	biggugdaghgug, curdakalmug.
	p5l4	
	p5l5	All present interjectional 
	p5l6	conjugations start with 
	p5l7	the letter G unless the(y) 
	p5l8	contain the third 
	p6l1	declensive accent of the 
	p6l2	letter U.
	p6l3	Examples: ghothudunglug, 
	p6l4	but n azhbuugub.
	p6l5	
	p6l6	The past tense can only 
	p6l7	refer to events since the 
	p6l8	last meal, but the 
	p7l1	prehensile tense can refer 
	p7l2	to any event within 
	p7l3	reach.
	p7l4	
	p7l5	The present tense is 
	p7l6	conjugated like the future 
	p7l7	imperfect tense, when the 
	p7l8	interrogative mode is used 
	p8l1	by pitching the sound a 
	p8l2	quarter-tone higher.
	p8l3	
	p8l4	Orcish hath no concept 
	p8l5	of person, as in first 
	p8l6	person, third person, I, 
	p8l7	we, etc.
	p8l8	
	p9l1	Orcish grammar relies 
	p9l2	upon the three cardinal 
	p9l3	rules of accretion, 
	p9l4	prefixing, and 
	p9l5	agglutination, in addition 
	p9l6	to pitch. In the former, 
	p9l7	phonemes combine into 
	p9l8	larger words which may 
	p10l1	contain full phrasal 
	p10l2	significance. In the second, 
	p10l3	prefixing specific phonetic 
	p10l4	sounds changes the 
	p10l5	subject of the sentence 
	p10l6	into object, interrogative, 
	p10l7	addressed individual, or 
	p10l8	dinner.
	p11l1	Agglutination occurs 
	p11l2	whenever four of the 
	p11l3	same letter are present 
	p11l4	in a word, in which case, 
	p11l5	any two of them may be 
	p11l6	removed or slurred.
	p11l7	Pitch changes the 
	p11l8	phoneme value of individual 
	p12l1	syllables, thus completely 
	p12l2	altering what a word may 
	p12l3	mean. The classic example 
	p12l4	if “Aktgluthugrot 
	p12l5	bigglogubuu dargilgaglug 
	p12l6	lublublub(“) which can 
	p12l7	mean “You are such a 
	p12l8	pretty girl,” “My 
	p13l1	mother ate your 
	p13l2	primroses,” or “Jellyfish 
	p13l3	nose paints alms potato,” 
	p13l4	depending on pitch.
	p13l5	
	p13l6	Orcish poetry often relies 
	p13l7	upon repeating the same 
	p13l8	phrase in multiple pitches, 
	p14l1	eve(n) changing pitch 
	p14l2	midword. None of this 
	p14l3	great are is translatable.
	p14l4	
	p14l5	The orcish language uses 
	p14l6	the following vowels: ab, 
	p14l7	ad, ag, akt, at, augh, auh, 
	p14l8	azh, e, i, o, oo, u, uu. 
	p15l1	The vowel sound a is not 
	p15l2	recognized as a vowel and 
	p15l3	does not exist in their 
	p15l4	alphabet. The orcish 
	p15l5	alphabet i(s) best learned 
	p15l6	using th(e) classic rhyme 
	p15l7	repeated at 23 different 
	p15l8	pitchs:
	p16l1	Lugnog ghu blat 
	p16l2	suggaroglug. Gaghbuu 
	p16l3	dakdar ab highugbo, 
	p16l4	Gothnogbuim ad 
	p16l5	gilgubbugbuilug Bilgeaugh 
	p16l6	thurggulg stuiggro!
	p16l7	A translation of the 
	p16l8	first pitch:
	p17l1	Eat food, the first 
	p17l2	letter is ab,
	p17l3	Kill people, the next 
	p17l4	lette(r) is ad,
	p17l5	I forget the rest 
	p17l6	But augh is in there 
	p17l7	somewhere!
	p17l8	What follows is a 
	p18l1	complete phonetic library 
	p18l2	of the orcish language: 
	p18l3	ab, ad, ag, akt, alm, at, 
	p18l4	augh, auh, azh, ba, ba, 
	p18l5	bag, bar, baz, bid, bilge, 
	p18l6	bo, bog, bog, brui, bu, 
	p18l7	buad, bug, bug, buil, buim, 
	p18l8	bum, buo, buor, buu, ca, 
	p19l1	car, clog, cro, cuk, cur, 
	p19l2	da, dagh, dagh, dak, dar, 
	p19l3	deak, der, dil, dit, dor, 
	p19l4	dre, dri, dru, du, dud, 
	p19l5	duf, dug, dug, duh, dun, 
	p19l6	eag, eg, egg, eichel, ek, 
	p19l7	ep, ewk, faugh, fid, flu, 
	p19l8	fog, foo, foz, fruk, fu, 
	p20l1	fub, fud, fun, fup, fur, 
	p20l2	gaa, gag, gagh, gan, gar, 
	p20l3	gh, gha, ghat, ghed, ghid, 
	p20l4	gho, ghu, gig, gil, gka, glu, 
	p20l5	glu, glug, gna, gno, gnu, 
	p20l6	gol, gom, goth, grunt, 
	p20l7	grut, gu, gub, gub, gug, 
	p20l8	gug, gugh, guk, guk,
	p21l1	(Transcriber’s Note: The 
	p21l2	remainder of the orcish 
	p21l3	language is not present in

	title	A Call to Anarchy
	author	Lord Blackthorn
	p1l1	A Politic Call to Anarchy
	p1l2	
	p1l3	Let it never be said that 
	p1l4	I have augh(t) as quarrel 
	p1l5	with my liege Lord 
	p1l6	British, for indeed we be 
	p1l7	of the best of friends, 
	p1l8	sharing amicable games of 
	p2l1	chess ‘pon winter’s 
	p2l2	night, and talking at 
	p2l3	length into the wee hours 
	p2l4	of the issues that affect 
	p2l5	the realm of Britannia.
	p2l6	
	p2l7	Yet true friendship doth 
	p2l8	not prevent true 
	p3l1	philosophical disagreement 
	p3l2	either. While I view with 
	p3l3	approval my lord’s 
	p3l4	affection for his carefully 
	p3l5	crafted philosophy of the 
	p3l6	Eight Virtues, wherein 
	p3l7	moral behavior is 
	p3l8	encouraged in the 
	p4l1	populace, I view with less 
	p4l2	approval the expenditure 
	p4l3	of public funds upon the 
	p4l4	construction of 
	p4l5	“shrines” to said ideals.
	p4l6	
	p4l7	The issue is not on(e) of 
	p4l8	funds, however, but a 
	p5l1	disagreement most 
	p5l2	intellectual over the 
	p5l3	proper way of humankind 
	p5l4	in an ethical sense. 
	p5l5	Surely freedom of 
	p5l6	decision must be regarded 
	p5l7	as paramount in any such 
	p5l8	moral decision? Though 
	p6l1	none fail to censure the 
	p6l2	murderer, a subtler 
	p6l3	question arises when we 
	p6l4	ask if his behavior would 
	p6l5	be ethical if he were 
	p6l6	forced to it.
	p6l7	
	p6l8	I say to thee, the 
	p7l1	reader, quite flatly, that 
	p7l2	no ethical system shall 
	p7l3	have sway over me unless 
	p7l4	it convinceth me, for 
	p7l5	that freely made choice 
	p7l6	is to me the sigh that 
	p7l7	the system has validity.
	p7l8	
	p8l1	Whereas the system of 
	p8l2	“Virtues” that my liege 
	p8l3	espouses is indeed a 
	p8l4	compilation of commonly 
	p8l5	approved virtues, I 
	p8l6	approve of it. Where it 
	p8l7	seeks to control the 
	p8l8	populace and restrict 
	p9l1	their diversity and their 
	p9l2	range of behaviors, I 
	p9l3	quarrel with it. And thus 
	p9l4	do I issue this politic call 
	p9l5	to anarchy, whilst humbly 
	p9l6	begging forgivness of 
	p9l7	Lord British for my 
	p9l8	impertinence:
	p10l1	Celebrate thy differences. 
	p10l2	Take thy actions 
	p10l3	according to they own 
	p10l4	lights. Question from 
	p10l5	what source a law, a 
	p10l6	rule, a judge, and a 
	p10l7	virtue may arise. ‘Twere 
	p10l8	possible (though I suggest 
	p11l1	it not seriously) that a 
	p11l2	daemon planted the seed 
	p11l3	of these “Virtues” in 
	p11l4	my Lord British’s mind; 
	p11l5	’twere possible that the 
	p11l6	Shrines were but a plan 
	p11l7	to destroy this world. 
	p11l8	Thou canst not know 
	p12l1	unless thou questioneth, 
	p12l2	doubteth, and in the end, 
	p12l3	unless thou relyest upon 
	p12l4	THYSELF and they 
	p12l5	judgement. I offer these 
	p12l6	words as mere 
	p12l7	philosophical musings for 
	p12l8	those who seek 
	p13l1	enlightenment, for ’tis 
	p13l2	the issue that hath 
	p13l3	occupied mine interest and 
	p13l4	that of Lord British for 
	p13l5	some time now.

	title	A Primer on Arms
	author	Martin
	p1l1	ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
	p1l2	Martin was, for most of 
	p1l3	his life, the 
	p1l4	Weaponsmaster of 
	p1l5	Serpent’s Hold, until his 
	p1l6	death at 92, of an 
	p1l7	overgrown bunion.
	p1l8	
	p2l1	These are the basic 
	p2l2	element to consider in 
	p2l3	assessing a weapon of 
	p2l4	which all warrior who 
	p2l5	regard themselves as 
	p2l6	more than mere 
	p2l7	mercenaries should be 
	p2l8	aware. First and most 
	p3l1	obvious is the amount of 
	p3l2	damage that the weapon 
	p3l3	may do against 
	p3l4	unprotected flesh. While 
	p3l5	’tis this that first 
	p3l6	attracts the attention of 
	p3l7	the novice, ’tis a deadly 
	p3l8	mistake to regard it as 
	p4l1	the sole value of a 
	p4l2	weapon. While it may 
	p4l3	prove devastating indeed 
	p4l4	as a means of causing 
	p4l5	damage, a weapon must 
	p4l6	also serve as stout shield 
	p4l7	when engaged in combat.
	p4l8	
	p5l1	Hence the second issue 
	p5l2	to which to pay attention 
	p5l3	is the amount of 
	p5l4	protection that a weapon 
	p5l5	may offer. Pay close 
	p5l6	attention to the guard on 
	p5l7	it, if it be a blade, or 
	p5l8	the stoutness of it’s 
	p6l1	wood if it is a polearm. 
	p6l2	Oft related to this is 
	p6l3	the wait of a weapon, 
	p6l4	for a heavy weapon is 
	p6l5	more difficult to 
	p6l6	maneuver to block with, 
	p6l7	though it may do more 
	p6l8	damage to they opponent. 
	p7l1	If a weapon is too heavy 
	p7l2	for the wielder to move 
	p7l3	it freely, they should 
	p7l4	choose another and not 
	p7l5	attempt to prove their 
	p7l6	prowess by the size of 
	p7l7	their sword.
	p7l8	
	p8l1	The reach of the weapon 
	p8l2	both increase its 
	p8l3	defensive ability, and 
	p8l4	renders it more useful in 
	p8l5	open spaces as it allows 
	p8l6	attack against the 
	p8l7	opponent without the need 
	p8l8	to close. But be aware 
	p9l1	of the limitations of thy 
	p9l2	weapon! For a weapon 
	p9l3	with great reach may be 
	p9l4	useless in close quarter, 
	p9l5	for lack of space to 
	p9l6	maneuver it. Should that 
	p9l7	dagger-wielding enemy 
	p9l8	close on thee and they 
	p10l1	halberd, ’tis best to flee.
	p10l2	
	p10l3	Lastly, a factor that 
	p10l4	must always be considered 
	p10l5	is the condition of the 
	p10l6	weapon. It might be a 
	p10l7	wondrous magical blade of 
	p10l8	surpassing sharpness and 
	p11l1	it may leap to block 
	p11l2	blows with a mind of its 
	p11l3	own. It also might be of 
	p11l4	such flimsy construction, 
	p11l5	or damaged to such an 
	p11l6	extent, that the first 
	p11l7	time it clangs against 
	p11l8	steel, ’twill shatter into 
	p12l1	useless shards. Seek ye a 
	p12l2	good blacksmith should 
	p12l3	they weapon become 
	p12l4	damaged, but be aware 
	p12l5	that their ministrations 
	p12l6	may simply make the 
	p12l7	matter worse.
	p12l8	
	p13l1	While mages of some 
	p13l2	ability oft create magical 
	p13l3	weapons which enhance 
	p13l4	skill, are preternaturally 
	p13l5	sharp, or incinerate the 
	p13l6	enemy as they fall, to 
	p13l7	mind the greatest gift 
	p13l8	that they can grant a 
	p14l1	stout sword is to make 
	p14l2	it resistant to damage, 
	p14l3	for they own skill can 
	p14l4	make up the difference. 
	p14l5	Except for the fireball, 
	p14l6	but if the corpse is 
	p14l7	charred, then so will be 
	p14l8	the possessions, which 
	p15l1	maketh looting difficult!

	p1l1	The first bear did swim 
	p1l2	by day,
	p1l3	And it did sleep by night,
	p1l4	It kept itself within its

	p2l6	Of joy for all to see.
	p2l7	
	p2l8	The first bear, well, 
	p3l1	’twas hunted,
	p3l2	And today adorns a floor.
	p3l3	Its ruggish face has been

	title	A Tale of Three Tribes
	author	Janet, scribe
	p1l1	The dungeon known as 
	p1l2	Despise is in fact not a 
	p1l3	dungeon as such, but 
	p1l4	rather a large natural 
	p1l5	cave. Inhospitable and 
	p1l6	unfriendly to visitors, it 
	p1l7	is filled with damp spots 
	p1l8	where the deadly Exploding 
	p2l1	Red Spotted Toadstool 
	p2l2	grows in abundance.
	p2l3	
	p2l4	According to the oldest 
	p2l5	of historical texts, in 
	p2l6	days gone by the cave 
	p2l7	was once the home of 
	p2l8	three separate tribes who 
	p3l1	had come to an 
	p3l2	accommodation with each 
	p3l3	other. Oddly enough, the 
	p3l4	three tribes were of 
	p3l5	dragons, lizard men, and 
	p3l6	rat men. While today few 
	p3l7	except extremists 
	p3l8	associated with Lord 
	p4l1	Blackthorn regard these 
	p4l2	latter two as being 
	p4l3	intelligent beings, 
	p4l4	apparently they have 
	p4l5	indeed fallen from a more 
	p4l6	evolved state over the 
	p4l7	years.
	p4l8	
	p5l1	‘Tis said that these 
	p5l2	three races did dwell in 
	p5l3	relative harmony within 
	p5l4	the vast cave, building 
	p5l5	when they required it, 
	p5l6	and trading amongst 
	p5l7	themselves if needed.
	p5l8	
	p6l1	But over time, something 
	p6l2	happened, and they were 
	p6l3	forced to withdraw from 
	p6l4	their society, until today 
	p6l5	thou mayst find individuals 
	p6l6	of each species within 
	p6l7	the dungeon, but never 
	p6l8	again as a civilization.
	p7l1	‘Tis also said that 
	p7l2	someday the three tribes 
	p7l3	may return to Despise, 
	p7l4	to once again inhabit it 
	p7l5	together.
	p7l6	
	p7l7	Until then, nothing 
	p7l8	remains as a token of 
	p8l1	this save an oddly 
	p8l2	intelligent skeleton, 
	p8l3	magically enchanted, that 
	p8l4	doth speak when questions 
	p8l5	are asked, and from 
	p8l6	whom I obtained these 
	p8l7	tales one day, when I was 
	p8l8	pursued by evil monsters 
	p9l1	and fled into his skeletal 
	p9l2	arms.
	p9l3	
	p9l4	Fortunately, I escaped and 
	p9l5	lived to write it all down!

	title	A Welcome
	author	Lord Blackthorn
	p1l1	Greetings to you, new 
	p1l2	member of the Trusted.
	p1l3	You now read these 
	p1l4	words because you have 
	p1l5	been deemed worthy to 
	p1l6	join the ranks of 
	p1l7	Britannia’s defenders. 
	p1l8	Some will call you a 
	p2l1	betrayer of mankind, I 
	p2l2	say they are misguided. I 
	p2l3	call you a defender for 
	p2l4	Sosaria needs saving from 
	p2l5	itself. The forces of 
	p2l6	order once ruled our 
	p2l7	world. Like a great 
	p2l8	darkness over our lives 
	p3l1	we lived under the 
	p3l2	oppressive watch of a 
	p3l3	king who dictated our 
	p3l4	actions and passed 
	p3l5	judgement on our 
	p3l6	character. He suppressed 
	p3l7	our way of life by 
	p3l8	denying our freedom and 
	p4l1	the ability to determine 
	p4l2	who we are and what we 
	p4l3	stand for. Even today in 
	p4l4	the absense of this man 
	p4l5	we still see the symbol 
	p4l6	of his tyranny, we watch 
	p4l7	his personal guards patrol 
	p4l8	the cities to intimidate 
	p5l1	us, and we feel his laws 
	p5l2	like a vice on our lives.
	p5l3	
	p5l4	You are here because you 
	p5l5	choose to be free. Like 
	p5l6	many Britannians you have 
	p5l7	felt the opression of one 
	p5l8	man’s ideas weighing down 
	p6l1	upon you like chains. You 
	p6l2	have felt the embrace of 
	p6l3	fear, wondering if you 
	p6l4	face consequence for 
	p6l5	simply having ideas not in 
	p6l6	harmony with those 
	p6l7	forced upon you. You 
	p6l8	have seen men fight and 
	p7l1	die for the principles of 
	p7l2	a zealot and wondered, 
	p7l3	‘Who will fight for my 
	p7l4	principles should they be 
	p7l5	opposed?’ You tire of 
	p7l6	living under the shadow 
	p7l7	of dreams that do not 
	p7l8	belong to you. And most 
	p8l1	of all, you have wondered 
	p8l2	what you can do to live 
	p8l3	free.
	p8l4	Your journey to freedom 
	p8l5	begins here.
	p8l6	I, like you, once desired 
	p8l7	my freedom from the 
	p8l8	limits placed on me. I 
	p9l1	watched in disgust as 
	p9l2	this world became 
	p9l3	engrossed with the 
	p9l4	preaching of virtue and 
	p9l5	none of the practice. I 
	p9l6	held my convictions in 
	p9l7	check, fearful of the 
	p9l8	reaction of men blinded 
	p10l1	by belief. I forced myself 
	p10l2	to bury the very idealogy 
	p10l3	that made me an 
	p10l4	individual. I was fortunate 
	p10l5	that a being of unique 
	p10l6	power and unimaginable 
	p10l7	intelligence saw through 
	p10l8	to the true person I was, 
	p11l1	the person I was meant 
	p11l2	to be. Exodus found 
	p11l3	within me a man of free 
	p11l4	will, determination, and 
	p11l5	incomprehension for the 
	p11l6	plight of oppression 
	p11l7	forced on so many 
	p11l8	Britannians.
	p12l1	Exodus has also chosen 
	p12l2	you because of the 
	p12l3	strength of your 
	p12l4	character.
	p12l5	Many of the men who 
	p12l6	were once my peers look 
	p12l7	upon me and see a 
	p12l8	betrayer of humanity. 
	p13l1	They claim my newfound 
	p13l2	form is unnatural and 
	p13l3	wrong. Because they 
	p13l4	seethe unknown in me, 
	p13l5	they show fear. They 
	p13l6	disapprove of my choices 
	p13l7	and in their ignorance see 
	p13l8	evil. Yet I hide my true 
	p14l1	self no longer from these 
	p14l2	men. My thoughts and my 
	p14l3	personal morality have 
	p14l4	been liberated in the face 
	p14l5	of the oppression that 
	p14l6	once consumed me. Where 
	p14l7	they see a man no longer 
	p14l8	human. I see a man that 
	p15l1	has not betrayed his 
	p15l2	humanity but has been 
	p15l3	freed from it. This is 
	p15l4	the power that has been 
	p15l5	granted to me by Exodus. 
	p15l6	I have been given my 
	p15l7	freedom. I have been 
	p15l8	released from my fears. 
	p16l1	Exodus will give you the 
	p16l2	power to conquer your 
	p16l3	fears as well.
	p16l4	When your fear of this 
	p16l5	world is gone, then the 
	p16l6	world truly belongs to 
	p16l7	you in a way it never 
	p16l8	has before. You, trusted 
	p17l1	one, will soon be given a 
	p17l2	gift. Your body, like min, 
	p17l3	will be enlightened and 
	p17l4	raised to a new level no 
	p17l5	mortal can know. The 
	p17l6	power to control your 
	p17l7	own destiny will belong to 
	p17l8	you for the first time in 
	p18l1	your life. You will, at 
	p18l2	long last, be cleansed of 
	p18l3	fear.
	p18l4	Together, with the power 
	p18l5	of Exodus behind us, we 
	p18l6	shall finally wage war on 
	p18l7	the oppression that once 
	p18l8	held us back from our 
	p19l1	full potential. We shall 
	p19l2	claim this world, and 
	p19l3	reshape it in an image of 
	p19l4	freedom for all of us. 
	p19l5	Those who once told you 
	p19l6	who you are and how you 
	p19l7	should live will no longer 
	p19l8	be able to stand in the 
	p20l1	way of your free will. 
	p20l2	Many say you will be 
	p20l3	abandoning your humanity 
	p20l4	but in truth, you will be 
	p20l5	more than human.
	p20l6	You will be freed.

	title	Birds o Britannia
	author	Thomas th' Heathen
	p1l1	The WREN is a tiny 
	p1l2	insect-eating bird with a 
	p1l3	loud voic(e.) The cheerful 
	p1l4	trills of Wrens are 
	p1l5	extraordinarily varied and 
	p1l6	melodious.
	p1l7	
	p1l8	The SWALLOW is easily 
	p2l1	recognized by its forked 
	p2l2	tail. Swallows catch 
	p2l3	insects in flight, and have 
	p2l4	squeaky, twittering songs.
	p2l5	
	p2l6	The WARBLER is an 
	p2l7	exceptional singer, whose 
	p2l8	extensive songs combine 
	p3l1	the best qualities of 
	p3l2	Wrens and Swallows.
	p3l3	
	p3l4	The NUTHATCH climbs 
	p3l5	down trees headfirst, 
	p3l6	searching for insects in 
	p3l7	the bark. It sings a 
	p3l8	repetitive series of notes 
	p4l1	with a nasal tone quality.
	p4l2	
	p4l3	The agile CHICKADEE has 
	p4l4	a buzzy 
	p4l5	“chick-a-dee-dee” call, 
	p4l6	from which its name is 
	p4l7	derived. Its song is a 
	p4l8	series of whistled notes.
	p5l1	The THRUSH is a brown 
	p5l2	bird with a spotted 
	p5l3	breast, which eats worms 
	p5l4	and snails, and has a 
	p5l5	beautiful singing voice. 
	p5l6	Thrushes use a stone as 
	p5l7	an anvil to smash the 
	p5l8	shells of snails.
	p6l1	The little NIGHTINGALE is 
	p6l2	also known for its 
	p6l3	beautiful song, which it 
	p6l4	sings even at night.
	p6l5	
	p6l6	The STARLING is a small 
	p6l7	dark bird with a yellow 
	p6l8	bill an(d) a squeaky, 
	p7l1	high-pitched song. 
	p7l2	Starlings can mimic the 
	p7l3	sounds of other birds.
	p7l4	
	p7l5	The SKYLARK sings a 
	p7l6	series of high-pitched 
	p7l7	melodius trills in flight.
	p7l8	
	p8l1	The FINCH is a small 
	p8l2	seed-eating bird with a 
	p8l3	conical beak and a 
	p8l4	musical, warbling song.
	p8l5	
	p8l6	The CROSSBILL (sic) is a 
	p8l7	kind of Finch with a 
	p8l8	strange crossed bill, which 
	p9l1	it uses to extract seeds 
	p9l2	from pine cones.
	p9l3	
	p9l4	The CANARY is a kind of 
	p9l5	Finch that I often kept 
	p9l6	as a pet. Miners would 
	p9l7	often take Canaries 
	p9l8	underground with them, to 
	p10l1	warn them of the 
	p10l2	presence of hazardous 
	p10l3	vapors in the air.
	p10l4	
	p10l5	The SPARROW weaves a 
	p10l6	nest of grass, and has 
	p10l7	an unmusical chirp for 
	p10l8	voice.
	p11l1	The TOWHEE is a kind of 
	p11l2	Sparrow that continually 
	p11l3	reminds listeners to drink 
	p11l4	their tea.
	p11l5	
	p11l6	The SHRIKE is a gray 
	p11l7	bird with a hooked bill. 
	p11l8	Shrikes have the habit of 
	p12l1	impaling their prey on 
	p12l2	thorns.
	p12l3	
	p12l4	The WOODPECKER has a 
	p12l5	pointed beak that is 
	p12l6	suitable for pecking at 
	p12l7	wood to get at the 
	p12l8	insects inside.
	p13l1	The KINGFISHER dives for 
	p13l2	fish, which it catches 
	p13l3	with its long, pointed 
	p13l4	beak.
	p13l5	
	p13l6	The TERN migrates over 
	p13l7	great distances, from one 
	p13l8	end of Britannia to the 
	p14l1	other each year. Terns 
	p14l2	dive from the air to 
	p14l3	catch fish.
	p14l4	
	p14l5	The PLOVER is (a) bird 
	p14l6	that distracts predators 
	p14l7	by pretending to have a 
	p14l8	broken wing.
	p15l1	The LAPWING is a kind 
	p15l2	of Plover that has a long 
	p15l3	black crest.
	p15l4	
	p15l5	The HAWK is a predator 
	p15l6	that feeds o(n) small 
	p15l7	birds, mice, squirrels, and 
	p15l8	other small animals. Small 
	p16l1	hawks are known as 
	p16l2	Kites.
	p16l3	
	p16l4	The DOVE is a 
	p16l5	seed-eating bird with a 
	p16l6	peaceful reputation. Doves 
	p16l7	have a low-pitched cooing 
	p16l8	song.
	p17l1	The PARROT is (a) 
	p17l2	brightly colored bird with 
	p17l3	a hooked bill, favored as 
	p17l4	a companion by pirates(.) 
	p17l5	Parrots can be taught to 
	p17l6	imitate the human voice.
	p17l7	
	p17l8	
	p18l1	The CUCKOO is a devious 
	p18l2	bird that lays eggs in 
	p18l3	the nests of Warblers 
	p18l4	and other small birds. 
	p18l5	Cuckoos have the uncanny 
	p18l6	ability to keep track of 
	p18l7	time, singing once at the 
	p18l8	beginning of each hour.
	p19l1	The ROADRUNNER is an 
	p19l2	unusual bird with a long 
	p19l3	tail, which runs swiftly 
	p19l4	along the ground hunting 
	p19l5	for lizards and snakes.
	p19l6	
	p19l7	The SWIFT is a very 
	p19l8	agile bird that spends 
	p20l1	nearly its entire life in 
	p20l2	the air. With their 
	p20l3	mouths wide open, Swifts 
	p20l4	capture insects in 
	p20l5	mid-flight.
	p20l6	
	p20l7	The HUMMINGBIRD is a 
	p20l8	cross between a Swift 
	p21l1	and a Fairy. These tiny, 
	p21l2	brightly colored birds 
	p21l3	hover magically near 
	p21l4	flowers, and live on the 
	p21l5	nectar they provide.
	p21l6	
	p21l7	The OWL is a reputedly 
	p21l8	wise bird that is active 
	p22l1	at night, unlike most 
	p22l2	birds. Owls have excellent 
	p22l3	night vision and 
	p22l4	low-pitched hooting calls. 
	p22l5	Their wings are silent in 
	p22l6	flight.
	p22l7	
	p22l8	The GOATSUCKER is a 
	p23l1	strange owl-like bird that 
	p23l2	is thought to live on the 
	p23l3	milk of goats. These 
	p23l4	mysterious birds make 
	p23l5	jarring sounds at night, 
	p23l6	for which reason they 
	p23l7	are also called Nightjars.
	p23l8	
	p24l1	The DUCK is a bird that 
	p24l2	swims more than it flies, 
	p24l3	and has a nasal voice 
	p24l4	that is described best as 
	p24l5	a “quack”.
	p24l6	
	p24l7	The SWAN is a kind of 
	p24l8	long-necked Duck that is 
	p25l1	all white. Swans are 
	p25l2	usually voiceless, but they 
	p25l3	are said to have an 
	p25l4	extraordinarily beautiful 
	p25l5	song.

	title	Britannian flora
	author	Herbert the Lost
	p1l1	Britannian flora - A 
	p1l2	Casual Guide
	p1l3	
	p1l4	Oft ‘pon rambling 
	p1l5	through the woods 
	p1l6	avoiding bears have I 
	p1l7	spotted some plant whose 
	p1l8	like I have never seen 
	p2l1	before, and concluding 
	p2l2	that I was a blithering 
	p2l3	idiot for failing to notice 
	p2l4	it in the past. Equally as 
	p2l5	oft have I concluded that 
	p2l6	I was a worse idiot for 
	p2l7	not running faster from 
	p2l8	the bear.
	p3l1	While not all my readers 
	p3l2	may share my proclivites 
	p3l3	for tree-climbing, it 
	p3l4	occurred to me that 
	p3l5	mayhap mine information 
	p3l6	might serve some humble 
	p3l7	purpose.
	p3l8	
	p4l1	The two most unique 
	p4l2	flower plants in the 
	p4l3	Britannian countryside are 
	p4l4	the orfleur and the 
	p4l5	whiteflower, also called 
	p4l6	white horns.
	p4l7	
	p4l8	
	p5l1	The orfleur is notable for 
	p5l2	its massive orange-red 
	p5l3	blossoms, which dwarf 
	p5l4	marigolds like the sun 
	p5l5	dwarfs you (sic) common 
	p5l6	fireball spell. The odor of 
	p5l7	said blooms is best 
	p5l8	described as 
	p6l1	peppermint-apple, with a 
	p6l2	dash of garlic. ‘Tis a 
	p6l3	popular potted plant 
	p6l4	despite, or perhaps 
	p6l5	because of, its exotic 
	p6l6	nature.
	p6l7	
	p6l8	
	p7l1	Whiteflowers exude a 
	p7l2	subtle fragrance not 
	p7l3	unlike that of freshly 
	p7l4	shaven wood mixed with 
	p7l5	cool lemon ice. Their tall 
	p7l6	stands always droop with 
	p7l7	the heavy weight of their 
	p7l8	massive blooms, oft as 
	p8l1	large as a child’s head.
	p8l2	The flowers are so large 
	p8l3	that one may scoop out 
	p8l4	the pollen in handfuls, and 
	p8l5	during the spring season 
	p8l6	many a prank hath been 
	p8l7	played by idle boys ‘pon 
	p8l8	their sisters by dumping 
	p9l1	said pollen into their 
	p9l2	clothing drawers, causing 
	p9l3	sneezes for days.
	p9l4	
	p9l5	The most interesting 
	p9l6	native tree to Britannia 
	p9l7	is the spider tree. The 
	p9l8	reason for its naming is 
	p10l1	obscure, but may have to 
	p10l2	do with the twisted gray 
	p10l3	stalks from which the 
	p10l4	spherical canopy sprouts. 
	p10l5	‘Tis something of a 
	p10l6	misnomer to term these 
	p10l7	“trunks” as they are 
	p10l8	spindly and flexible. Spider 
	p11l1	trees provide a fresh, 
	p11l2	piney smell to a room 
	p11l3	and are therefore often 
	p11l4	potted.
	p11l5	
	p11l6	In jungle climes, one finds 
	p11l7	the blade plant, whose 
	p11l8	sharp leaves oft collect 
	p12l1	water for the thirsty 
	p12l2	traveler, yet can draw 
	p12l3	blood easily.
	p12l4	
	p12l5	The deadliest plant, if you 
	p12l6	can call a fungus a plant, 
	p12l7	is the Exploding Red 
	p12l8	Spotted Toadstool. No 
	p13l1	pattern can be discerned 
	p13l2	to its habitats save 
	p13l3	malice, for merely 
	p13l4	approaching results in the 
	p13l5	cap exploding with powder, 
	p13l6	noxious gas, and tiny 
	p13l7	painful pellets flying in all 
	p13l8	directions.
	p14l1	Unfortunately, ’tis 
	p14l2	impossible to tell it apart 
	p14l3	from the Ordinary Red 
	p14l4	Spotted Toadstool save 
	p14l5	through experimentation.
	p14l6	
	p14l7	
	p14l8	
	p15l1	Truly odd among the 
	p15l2	varied flora of Britannia, 
	p15l3	however, are those which 
	p15l4	bear names clearly alien 
	p15l5	to our tongue. Among 
	p15l6	these I name the Tuscany 
	p15l7	pine (for I have never 
	p15l8	seen a region of this 
	p16l1	world named Tuscany), the 
	p16l2	o’hii tree, whose very 
	p16l3	name sounds like some 
	p16l4	tropical isle, and the 
	p16l5	welsh poppy, which while 
	p16l6	different from an

	author	Fylwyn
	p1l1	I don’t hold with the 
	p1l2	overblown, self 
	p1l3	congratulatory boasting of 
	p1l4	adventurers, I find them 
	p1l5	lacking the facts, the 
	p1l6	substance, that prove a 
	p1l7	compelling read. So why, 
	p1l8	you might ask, gentile 
	p2l1	reader, have I rendered 
	p2l2	my thoughts in this same 
	p2l3	medium? Having expressed 
	p2l4	my disdain for the 
	p2l5	dubious tales of others, 
	p2l6	this must seem 
	p2l7	hypocritical or self 
	p2l8	indulgent.
	p3l1	I have little defence, save 
	p3l2	that posterity must have 
	p3l3	a record of this 
	p3l4	discovery and I am the 
	p3l5	only one who has the 
	p3l6	knowledge, and can tell 
	p3l7	the tale. As I am a 
	p3l8	retiring person, not prone 
	p4l1	to boisterous revels or 
	p4l2	even the presence of 
	p4l3	others save the closest 
	p4l4	of friends. I set out 
	p4l5	alone, I had no particular 
	p4l6	destination in mind and it 
	p4l7	was after weeks of 
	p4l8	wandering that I 
	p5l1	encountered the most 
	p5l2	marvelous sight.
	p5l3	
	p5l4	You must understand. I 
	p5l5	was in a mountainous 
	p5l6	area, surrounded on all 
	p5l7	sides by majestic snow 
	p5l8	capped peaks. The air was 
	p6l1	crisp and refeshing and a 
	p6l2	pleasant stream burbled 
	p6l3	past. I decided to refill 
	p6l4	my drinking skins from 
	p6l5	the cool water flowing by, 
	p6l6	and it was then that I 
	p6l7	made my first startling 
	p6l8	discovery. The water was 
	p7l1	black!
	p7l2	
	p7l3	No, I know what you’re 
	p7l4	thinking, the water must 
	p7l5	have been very deep, or 
	p7l6	the stones themselves 
	p7l7	black. But this was no 
	p7l8	illusion, the water was no 
	p8l1	deeper than a foot and 
	p8l2	the liquid a silky black 
	p8l3	color quite unlike the 
	p8l4	normal clairity one sees. I 
	p8l5	was mystified, of course. 
	p8l6	What could cause one of 
	p8l7	the most basic elements 
	p8l8	of life to change in such 
	p9l1	a manner? What might 
	p9l2	this portend?
	p9l3	
	p9l4	As I mused over the 
	p9l5	implications, I was 
	p9l6	startled from my reverie 
	p9l7	by a noise, not unlike the 
	p9l8	snorting of a bull. Imagine 
	p10l1	my amazement when I 
	p10l2	turned to see what might 
	p10l3	have crept upon me and 
	p10l4	beheld a jet steed of 
	p10l5	such noble proportions 
	p10l6	that I felt I must be 
	p10l7	gazing upon the paragon 
	p10l8	of horses. From the 
	p11l1	proud arch of the neck 
	p11l2	to the powerful of 
	p11l3	muscles just under the 
	p11l4	skin this equine shown 
	p11l5	with unmistakable magic. 
	p11l6	Unconcerned with my 
	p11l7	presence, the lordly 
	p11l8	creature drank calmly 
	p12l1	from the strange water. 
	p12l2	With each gulp of the 
	p12l3	liquid, the stallion’s coat 
	p12l4	dulled and became thicker, 
	p12l5	coarser. The glorious 
	p12l6	cascade of mane darkened 
	p12l7	till even the word pitch 
	p12l8	cannot describe the utter 
	p13l1	absence of color. I was 
	p13l2	witnessing a 
	p13l3	transformation that I 
	p13l4	feared harmed this 
	p13l5	magnificent beast and so 
	p13l6	I took the only action 
	p13l7	that seemed reasonable at 
	p13l8	the time.
	p14l1	I yelled, I screamed, I 
	p14l2	shouted… I shoved 
	p14l3	against the creatures 
	p14l4	mighty body trying to 
	p14l5	force it away from the 
	p14l6	tainted water, But, alas, 
	p14l7	to no avail. Once, the 
	p14l8	equine turned and gazed 
	p15l1	upon me with bright, 
	p15l2	intellegent eyes, before 
	p15l3	returning to quench its 
	p15l4	mighty thirst. In horror I 
	p15l5	stood transfixed as the 
	p15l6	final metamorphosis took 
	p15l7	place. And then, abruptly 
	p15l8	I knew nothing more.
	p16l1	I awoke, bound roughly 
	p16l2	and lying on my side. I 
	p16l3	was clearly the cause of 
	p16l4	an argument between 
	p16l5	several people, who could 
	p16l6	only be my captors. My 
	p16l7	head pounding and blood 
	p16l8	thrumming painfully in my 
	p17l1	bound limbs. I strained to 
	p17l2	hear the conversation. I 
	p17l3	overheard just enough to 
	p17l4	become very afraid. For 
	p17l5	you see, gentile readers, 
	p17l6	these people who call 
	p17l7	themselves the Cult of 
	p17l8	the Fallen are servents 
	p18l1	of Mondain. Though dead, 
	p18l2	the legacy of the wizard 
	p18l3	lives on in theminds of 
	p18l4	his followers. They work 
	p18l5	for vengence alone, for 
	p18l6	teh corruption of Sosaria 
	p18l7	and the destruction of all 
	p18l8	who stand against them.
	p19l1	I escaped, as you surely 
	p19l2	have devined, for how 
	p19l3	else could I give warning? 
	p19l4	The story of my flight is 
	p19l5	not important and so I 
	p19l6	will not waste further ink 
	p19l7	on discussion of it.
	p19l8	
	p20l1	Be warned, my readers… 
	p20l2	be warned. There are 
	p20l3	those, amongst us, who 
	p20l4	seek the unravelling of 
	p20l5	Sosaria. -Fylwyn

	p7l1	COMMENTARY
	p7l2	
	p7l3	The meaning of this verse 
	p7l4	has oft been discussed in 
	p7l5	halls of scholarly sorts.
	p7l6	
	p7l7	Perhaps it is but the 
	p7l8	remnant of a longer 
	p8l1	ballad once extant, for 
	p8l2	there are internal 
	p8l3	indications that it once 
	p8l4	told a longer story about 
	p8l5	ill-fated lovers, and 
	p8l6	magical experiment gone 
	p8l7	awry. However, poetic 
	p8l8	license and the folk 
	p9l1	process has distorted the 
	p9l2	words until now the locale 
	p9l3	of the tale is no more 
	p9l4	than “in the wind,” 
	p9l5	which while it serves a 
	p9l6	pleasingly metaphorical 
	p9l7	purpose, fails to inform 
	p9l8	the listener as to any 
	p10l1	real locale!
	p10l2	
	p10l3	Another possibility is that 
	p10l4	this is some form of 
	p10l5	creation myth explaining 
	p10l6	the genesis of the 
	p10l7	various humanoid 
	p10l8	creatures that roam the 
	p11l1	lands of Britannia. It 
	p11l2	does not take a stretch 
	p11l3	of the imagination to 
	p11l4	name the middle verse’s 
	p11l5	“girl becomes tree” as 
	p11l6	a possible explanation for 
	p11l7	the reaper, for in the 
	p11l8	area surrounding Minoc, 
	p12l1	reapers are oft referred 
	p12l2	to amon the lumberjacking 
	p12l3	community as 
	p12l4	“widowmakers.”
	p12l5	
	p12l6	The verse seems to imply 
	p12l7	a long ago creator, and 
	p12l8	uses the antique magickal 
	p13l1	terminology of “plaiting 
	p13l2	strands of ether” that 
	p13l3	is so often found in 
	p13l4	ancient texts. In addition, 
	p13l5	the reference to 
	p13l6	“snakehills” may well be 
	p13l7	regarded as a reference 
	p13l8	to an actual location, 
	p14l1	such as perhaps a local 
	p14l2	term for the Serpent’s 
	p14l3	Spine.
	p14l4	
	p14l5	A commoner interpretation 
	p14l6	is that like many nursery 
	p14l7	rhymes, it is a simple 
	p14l8	explanation for death, 
	p15l1	whereing the wind 
	p15l2	snatches up boys and 
	p15l3	girls when they sleep in 
	p15l4	order to keep the balance 
	p15l5	of the world. Notable 
	p15l6	tales have been written 
	p15l7	for children of adventures 
	p15l8	in “the Snakehills,” 
	p16l1	which are presumed to be 
	p16l2	an Afterworld whence the 
	p16l3	spirit liveth on. A grim 
	p16l4	lullabye, to be sure, but 
	p16l5	no worse than “lest I 
	p16l6	die before I wake” 
	p16l7	surely.
	p16l8	
	p17l1	In either case, ’tis an 
	p17l2	old favorite, hering 
	p17l3	printed for the first 
	p17l4	time for thy enjoyment 
	p17l5	and perusal!

	p2l8	
	p3l1	COMMENTARY
	p3l2	
	p3l3	A common rhyme for 
	p3l4	little babies, ’tis thought 
	p3l5	that this littl(e) ditty is 
	p3l6	part of the corpus of 
	p3l7	legendary tales regarding 
	p3l8	the world before Sosaria 
	p4l1	(see the wonderful fables 
	p4l2	of Fabio the Poor for 
	p4l3	fictionalized versions of 
	p4l4	these stories, also 
	p4l5	available from this same 
	p4l6	publisher). According to 
	p4l7	these old tales, which 
	p4l8	survive mostly in th(e) 
	p5l1	hills and remote villages 
	p5l2	where Lord British is as 
	p5l3	yet a distant and 
	p5l4	mythical ruler, the gods 
	p5l5	of old (a fanciful notion!) 
	p5l6	met to discuss the 
	p5l7	progress of creating the 
	p5l8	world in mystical rooms. 
	p6l1	A simple analysis reveals 
	p6l2	these rooms to be mere 
	p6l3	mythological 
	p6l4	generalizations.
	p6l5	
	p6l6	“The Star Chamber” is 
	p6l7	clearly a reference to 
	p6l8	the sky. “The Pit” is 
	p7l1	certainl(y) an Underworld 
	p7l2	analogous to the Snake 
	p7l3	hills of other tales, and 
	p7l4	“the Glass House” is no 
	p7l5	doubt the vantage point 
	p7l6	from which the gods 
	p7l7	observed their creation. 
	p7l8	All is simple when seen 
	p8l1	from this perspective, 
	p8l2	leaving only the 
	p8l3	mysterious reference to 
	p8l4	dinners(.) Oddly enough 
	p8l5	the rhyme is universally(y) 
	p8l6	used only for midnight 
	p8l7	feedings, never during the 
	p8l8	day.

	p2l4	Preface by Guilhem the 
	p2l5	Scholar
	p2l6	
	p2l7	The meaning of this verse 
	p2l8	has oft been discussed in 
	p3l1	halls of scholarly sorts, 
	p3l2	for its mysterious 
	p3l3	singsongy melody is oddly 
	p3l4	disturbing to adult ears, 
	p3l5	though children seem to 
	p3l6	find it restful as they 
	p3l7	sleep. Perhaps it is but 
	p3l8	the remnant of a longer 
	p4l1	ballad once extant, for 
	p4l2	there are internal 
	p4l3	indications that it once 
	p4l4	told a longer story about 
	p4l5	ill-fated lovers, and a 
	p4l6	magical experiment gone 
	p4l7	awry. However, poetic 
	p4l8	license and the folk 
	p5l1	process has distorted the 
	p5l2	words until now the locale 
	p5l3	o(f?) the tale is no more 
	p5l4	than “in the wind,” 
	p5l5	which while it serves a 
	p5l6	pleasingly metaphorical 
	p5l7	purpose, fails to inform 
	p5l8	the listener as to any 
	p6l1	real locale!
	p6l2	
	p6l3	Another possibility is that 
	p6l4	this is some form of 
	p6l5	creation myth explaining 
	p6l6	the genesis of the 
	p6l7	variou(s) humanoid 
	p6l8	creatures that roam the

	p7l2	does not take a stretch 
	p7l3	of the imagination to 
	p7l4	name the middle verse’s 
	p7l5	“girl becomes a tree” 
	p7l6	as a possible explanation 
	p7l7	for the reaper, for in 
	p7l8	the area surrounding 
	p8l1	Minoc, reapers are oft 
	p8l2	referred to among the 
	p8l3	lumber jacking community 
	p8l4	as “widowmakers.” That 
	p8l5	these creatures are of 
	p8l6	arcane origin is assumed, 
	p8l7	but the verse seems to 
	p8l8	imply a long ago creator, 
	p9l1	and uses the antique 
	p9l2	magickal terminology of 
	p9l3	“plaiting strands of 
	p9l4	ether” that is so often 
	p9l5	found in ancient texts. In 
	p9l6	addition, the reference to 
	p9l7	“snakehills” may 
	p9l8	profitably be regarde(d) 
	p10l1	as a reference to an 
	p10l2	actual location, such as 
	p10l3	perhaps a local term for 
	p10l4	the Serpent’s Spine.

	p10l6	A commoner interpretation 
	p10l7	is that like many nursery

	author	Mercenary Justin
	p1l1	Deceit - A Dungeon of 
	p1l2	Horrors
	p1l3	My employers have oft 
	p1l4	taken me into this den 
	p1l5	of hideous creatures, and 
	p1l6	I thought that it 
	p1l7	behooved me to write 
	p1l8	down what I know of it, 
	p2l1	now that I am retired 
	p2l2	from the life of an 
	p2l3	adventurer for hire.
	p2l4	
	p2l5	Deceit was once a temple 
	p2l6	to forgotten powers of 
	p2l7	old. It was taken over by 
	p2l8	mages who eventually 
	p3l1	were driven out by the 
	p3l2	depredations of their own 
	p3l3	evil lackeys. However, 
	p3l4	many of the magical 
	p3l5	traps and devices that 
	p3l6	they placed for their 
	p3l7	defenses remain, 
	p3l8	particularly those the 
	p4l1	wizards used to protect 
	p4l2	their treasures.
	p4l3	
	p4l4	The dungeon is mystically 
	p4l5	linked by crystal balls 
	p4l6	placed in different 
	p4l7	locations. These magical 
	p4l8	orbs do transmit speech, 
	p5l1	and even have memory of 
	p5l2	things that have been 
	p5l3	said near them. No doubt 
	p5l4	they once served as a 
	p5l5	warning system.
	p5l6	
	p5l7	Be wary of a brazier 
	p5l8	that giveth warning when 
	p6l1	approached: thou canst 
	p6l2	use it to summon deadly 
	p6l3	creatures.
	p6l4	
	p6l5	There be a tantalizing 
	p6l6	chest, undoubtedly full of 
	p6l7	treasure, that cannot be 
	p6l8	reached save past a 
	p7l1	complex series of 
	p7l2	pressure plates that 
	p7l3	trigger deadly spikes. As 
	p7l4	I never had sufficient 
	p7l5	folk with me to unlock 
	p7l6	the puzzle, I never 
	p7l7	obtained the riches that 
	p7l8	awaited there.
	p8l1	Do not investigate the 
	p8l2	iron maidens too closely, 
	p8l3	for they make suck you 
	p8l4	within them!
	p8l5	
	p8l6	There is one place where 
	p8l7	a deadly trap can only be 
	p8l8	disarmed by making use 
	p9l1	of a statue that cleverly 
	p9l2	conceals a lever.
	p9l3	
	p9l4	Oft one encounters the 
	p9l5	deadly exploding toadstool; 
	p9l6	the ones in Deceit are 
	p9l7	deadlier than most, as 
	p9l8	they explode continually. 
	p10l1	Likewise, the very pools 
	p10l2	of water and slime on 
	p10l3	the floor may poisen 
	p10l4	thee.
	p10l5	
	p10l6	The most magical device 
	p10l7	in the dungeon is a 
	p10l8	mystical bridge that can 
	p11l1	only be triggered by a 
	p11l2	lever embedded in the 
	p11l3	floor. Be wary, however, 
	p11l4	for the bridge thus 
	p11l5	created doth burst into 
	p11l6	flame when one passeth 
	p11l7	across it!

	title	Dimensional Travel
	author	Dryus Doost, Mage
	p1l1	A Monograph
	p1l2	Tis beyond the scope of 
	p1l3	this small monograph to 
	p1l4	discuss the details of 
	p1l5	moongates, and the 
	p1l6	manners in which they 
	p1l7	distort the fabric of 
	p1l8	reality in such a manner 
	p2l1	as to permit the passage 
	p2l2	of living flesh from place 
	p2l3	to place, world to world, 
	p2l4	or indeed from dimension 
	p2l5	to dimension.
	p2l6	
	p2l7	Instead, allow me to bring 
	p2l8	thy attention, Gentle 
	p3l1	Reader, to the curious 
	p3l2	characteristics that are 
	p3l3	shared by certain 
	p3l4	individuals within our 
	p3l5	realm.
	p3l6	
	p3l7	Long has it been known 
	p3l8	that the blue moongate 
	p4l1	permits travel from place 
	p4l2	to place, and none have 
	p4l3	trouble in taking this 
	p4l4	path. Yet ’tis also 
	p4l5	known, albeit only to a 
	p4l6	few, that certain 
	p4l7	individuals are unable to 
	p4l8	traverse the black 
	p5l1	moongates that permit 
	p5l2	travel from one dimension 
	p5l3	to another.
	p5l4	
	p5l5	The noted mage and peer 
	p5l6	of our realm, Lord 
	p5l7	Blackthorn, once told me 
	p5l8	in conversation that his 
	p6l1	arcane research had 
	p6l2	indicated that the issue 
	p6l3	was one of conservation 
	p6l4	of ether. To wit, given 
	p6l5	the postulate that matter 
	p6l6	within a given dimension 
	p6l7	may be but a 
	p6l8	cros-section of ethereal 
	p7l1	matter that exists in 
	p7l2	multiple dimensions, it 
	p7l3	becomes obvious that said 
	p7l4	ethereal structure cannot 
	p7l5	enter dimensions in which 
	p7l6	it is already present.
	p7l7	
	p7l8	Imagine an individual (and 
	p8l1	the Lord Blackthorn 
	p8l2	hinted that he was one 
	p8l3	such) who exist already in 
	p8l4	some form in multiple 
	p8l5	dimensions: said individual 
	p8l6	would not be able to 
	p8l7	cross into another 
	p8l8	dimension because HE IS 
	p9l1	ALREADY THERE.
	p9l2	
	p9l3	The implications of this 
	p9l4	are staggering, and merit 
	p9l5	further study. ‘Tis well 
	p9l6	known by theorists in the 
	p9l7	field that divisions in the 
	p9l8	ethereal structure of an 
	p10l1	individual are already 
	p10l2	implicit at the temporal 
	p10l3	level, as causality forces 
	p10l4	divisions upon the ether. 
	p10l5	This is the basic 
	p10l6	operating mechanism by 
	p10l7	which white moongates 
	p10l8	function, permitting time 
	p11l1	travel.
	p11l2	
	p11l3	As time travel is not 
	p11l4	barred by the presence 
	p11l5	of an earlier self (though 
	p11l6	encountering said earlier 
	p11l7	self can prove arcanely 
	p11l8	perilous), there must be 
	p12l1	some rigidity to the 
	p12l2	ethereal structure that 
	p12l3	bars multiple 
	p12l4	instantiations of 
	p12l5	structures from 
	p12l6	manifesting within the 
	p12l7	same context.
	p12l8	
	p13l1	If one regards time and 
	p13l2	causal bifurcation as a 
	p13l3	web, perhaps the 
	p13l4	appropriate analogy for 
	p13l5	dimensional matrices is 
	p13l6	that of a crystalline 
	p13l7	structure with rigid 
	p13l8	linkages.
	p14l1	The only way in which an 
	p14l2	individual such as Lord 
	p14l3	Blackthorn, who exists in 
	p14l4	multiple dimensional 
	p14l5	matrices, can cross 
	p14l6	worlds via a black 
	p14l7	moongate, would be for 
	p14l8	the entire crystalline 
	p15l1	structure of the 
	p15l2	dimension to perfectly 
	p15l3	match the ethereal 
	p15l4	resonance of the 
	p15l5	destination dimension.
	p15l6	
	p15l7	The problem of why 
	p15l8	certain individuals are 
	p16l1	already replicated in 
	p16l2	multiple crystalline 
	p16l3	matrices is one that I 
	p16l4	fail to provide any 
	p16l5	schema for in these poor 
	p16l6	theories. It is my fondest 
	p16l7	hope that someday 
	p16l8	someone shall conquer 
	p17l1	that thorny problem and 
	p17l2	enlighten the world.

	p1l4	Journal: Discovery of the 
	p1l5	Tomb, by Tavara Sewel

	p1l7	
	p1l8	
	p2l1	Day One:
	p2l2	The workers continue 
	p2l3	tireless in their efforts 
	p2l4	to unload our supplies 
	p2l5	even as light fades. I 
	p2l6	feel I should lend a hand 
	p2l7	in the effort, and yet I 
	p2l8	cannot bear to take my 
	p3l1	attention away from the 
	p3l2	magnificent stone doors 
	p3l3	of the tomb. Every inch 
	p3l4	of their massive frame is 
	p3l5	covered with intricately 
	p3l6	carved design work – 
	p3l7	’tis truly a sight to see. 
	p3l8	I’ve spent the day 
	p4l1	sketching and cataloging 
	p4l2	what I can of them while 
	p4l3	my companions set up our 
	p4l4	camp and make 
	p4l5	preparations for 
	p4l6	tomorrow’s work. Though 
	p4l7	the stonework symbols 
	p4l8	inspire me to new flights 
	p5l1	of fancy, some of the 
	p5l2	workers seem strangely 
	p5l3	fearful of them. I cannot 
	p5l4	wait ’til the morrow 
	p5l5	when those ancient works 
	p5l6	of stone shall swing open 
	p5l7	and deliver unto me 
	p5l8	everything I have dreamed 
	p6l1	of for the last ten 
	p6l2	years of my life.
	p6l3	
	p6l4	Day Two:
	p6l5	Everything we’d heard 
	p6l6	and read of the tomb 
	p6l7	has proved correct – 
	p6l8	and yet, nothing could 
	p7l1	prepare me for the sight 
	p7l2	of it with my own eyes. 
	p7l3	The Tomb of Khal Ankur 
	p7l4	has given up its secrets 
	p7l5	at last! The intricate 
	p7l6	stonework that covered 
	p7l7	the tomb doors seems to 
	p7l8	continue throughout the 
	p8l1	entirety of the 
	p8l2	catacombs, each hallway 
	p8l3	and room yielding a 
	p8l4	seemingly endless amount 
	p8l5	of information for my 
	p8l6	companions and I to 
	p8l7	record. It will take years 
	p8l8	to catalogue the entirety 
	p9l1	of the Tomb, if those 
	p9l2	legends of its massive 
	p9l3	size prove true. Sadly, a 
	p9l4	good deal (of) the Tomb’s 
	p9l5	interior has been damaged 
	p9l6	or utterly destroyed, 
	p9l7	whether by seismic 
	p9l8	activity in the surrounding 
	p10l1	mountainside or merely 
	p10l2	the slow efforts of Time 
	p10l3	itself, I do not know. A 
	p10l4	good deal of the 
	p10l5	stonework has been 
	p10l6	cracked or collapsed 
	p10l7	entirely, especially near 
	p10l8	the entrance supports of 
	p11l1	the main hall. Our 
	p11l2	passage has indeed already 
	p11l3	been entirely blocked in 
	p11l4	the first major room 
	p11l5	we’ve discovered, a 
	p11l6	massive pile of boulders 
	p11l7	and stones blocking any 
	p11l8	exit from the 
	p12l1	antechamber. What could 
	p12l2	have caused such a 
	p12l3	localized disruption of the 
	p12l4	support structures, one 
	p12l5	can only guess – but it 
	p12l6	will surely take an entire 
	p12l7	afternoon’s effort to 
	p12l8	remove even a fraction 
	p13l1	of it. I look forward to 
	p13l2	more progress tomorrow 
	p13l3	once the workers have 
	p13l4	set to excavating the 
	p13l5	hall.
	p13l6	
	p13l7	Day Three – Day Five:
	p13l8	I do not understand this 
	p14l1	place… not as I once 
	p14l2	thought I did. Something 
	p14l3	palatable seems to hinder 
	p14l4	our every attempt to 
	p14l5	investigate this ancient 
	p14l6	site. Excavation work on 
	p14l7	the first major hallway 
	p14l8	finished only yesterday – 
	p15l1	the amount of stone and 
	p15l2	rubble blocking the egress 
	p15l3	was astounding, it stands 
	p15l4	in immense piles outside 
	p15l5	the Tomb’s entrance, as 
	p15l6	if we were digging the 
	p15l7	tunnels of this abhorred 
	p15l8	place ourselves! The 
	p16l1	satisfaction of completing 
	p16l2	our efforts was quickly 
	p16l3	thwarted, however, as we 
	p16l4	discovered the end of the 
	p16l5	hallway we had just 
	p16l6	revealed was blocked by 
	p16l7	yet another colossal pile 
	p16l8	of stone. I’ve had a few 
	p17l1	of the workers set up 
	p17l2	primitive scaffolding in 
	p17l3	the main antechamber so 
	p17l4	that I can spend my time 
	p17l5	pouring over the detail 
	p17l6	work on the stone 
	p17l7	carvings while the rest 
	p17l8	of the crew continue 
	p18l1	excavating the inner halls.
	p18l2	Day Six:
	p18l3	Late last night our camp 
	p18l4	was set upon by a pack 
	p18l5	of wild beasts – 
	p18l6	behemoth creatures with 
	p18l7	a speed and viciousness 
	p18l8	I’d n’ere before seen. 
	p19l1	Even Grimmoch, well 
	p19l2	versed in all manner of 
	p19l3	wildlife, was unsure as to 
	p19l4	their nature – though I 
	p19l5	lay blame upon the 
	p19l6	darkness covering their 
	p19l7	movements rather than on 
	p19l8	his skill as a huntsman. 
	p20l1	The attacks did not let 
	p20l2	up the entire night, and 
	p20l3	we were eventually forced 
	p20l4	to flee into the Tomb 
	p20l5	itself to take refuge 
	p20l6	from the ravenous 
	p20l7	creatures – e’en 
	p20l8	Lysander’s spells could 
	p21l1	not keep the foul things 
	p21l2	from attacking in great 
	p21l3	numbers. The Tomb 
	p21l4	performed well as an 
	p21l5	impromptu fortress, and 
	p21l6	we managed to spend the 
	p21l7	night unscathed. Morning’s 
	p21l8	light seemed to have 
	p22l1	scattered the beasts, as 
	p22l2	not a single one of them 
	p22l3	was to be seen as exited 
	p22l4	the Tomb – not even a 
	p22l5	carcass of the few that 
	p22l6	were slain a’fore we 
	p22l7	fled. Lysander set the 
	p22l8	crew to work, moving our 
	p23l1	supplies and gear into the 
	p23l2	Tomb, in case the 
	p23l3	creatures did opt to 
	p23l4	return. Such savage fury 
	p23l5	had the beasts – and 
	p23l6	not a single one ever 
	p23l7	turned to run, even in 
	p23l8	the face of certain 
	p24l1	death.
	p24l2	Day Seven:
	p24l3	T’was written that, upon 
	p24l4	his death, Khal Ankur’s 
	p24l5	followers, those known as 
	p24l6	the Keepers of the Seven 
	p24l7	Death, sealed them selves 
	p24l8	within the Sanctum they 
	p25l1	had carved from the 
	p25l2	mountains in his honor. 
	p25l3	The Zealots of his order 
	p25l4	entombed the lesser 
	p25l5	followers alive, then, when 
	p25l6	all but two remained, slit 
	p25l7	their throats and joined 
	p25l8	Khal Ankhur in death. 
	p26l1	Surely this is not 
	p26l2	suprising for a Cult that 
	p26l3	worshipped death and 
	p26l4	sacrifice so vehemently as 
	p26l5	it is said that the 
	p26l6	Keepers did – and yet, 
	p26l7	to be in this Tomb, to 
	p26l8	know that somewhere in 
	p27l1	its depths hundreds upon 
	p27l2	hundreds of bodies lay, 
	p27l3	sealed alive at their own 
	p27l4	behest… I must confess 
	p27l5	that the very thought of 
	p27l6	it troubles my dreams at 
	p27l7	night. I’ve asked Lysander 
	p27l8	if we might reestablish 
	p28l1	the camp outside the 
	p28l2	Tomb, setting up night 
	p28l3	watches and some sort 
	p28l4	of fortification, but he’ll 
	p28l5	have none of it. I did not 
	p28l6	press the issue, as I 
	p28l7	suddenly felt foolish even 
	p28l8	at my askance.
	p29l1	Day Eight:
	p29l2	Astounding progress was 
	p29l3	made today, and my very 
	p29l4	head spins with the 
	p29l5	excitement of it. Upon 
	p29l6	full excavation of the far 
	p29l7	western hall, another 
	p29l8	large antechamber was 
	p30l1	revealed. By the larger, 
	p30l2	mosaic style of the wall 
	p30l3	carvings and their 
	p30l4	framing, as well as the 
	p30l5	numerous vellum scrolls 
	p30l6	and tomes held within, 
	p30l7	the room appears to have 
	p30l8	been a great museum or 
	p31l1	library of sorts. The 
	p31l2	sheer amount of written 
	p31l3	information encased within 
	p31l4	this room would surely 
	p31l5	take me decades to study 
	p31l6	e’en if I could 
	p31l7	immediately decipher the 
	p31l8	strange text with which 
	p32l1	it was written. My sheer 
	p32l2	joy at the discovery was 
	p32l3	quickly noted by the 
	p32l4	brute known as Morg 
	p32l5	Bergen, who, even in his 
	p32l6	simple way, seemed just 
	p32l7	as delighted as I that 
	p32l8	some progress had been 
	p33l1	made. I must confess, 
	p33l2	upon his inclusion in our 
	p33l3	party at the beginning of 
	p33l4	this journey I was 
	p33l5	somewhat suspect of his 
	p33l6	nature, but he has a 
	p33l7	startingly quick wit about 
	p33l8	him for such a massive, 
	p34l1	calloused warrior. While 
	p34l2	Lysander and e’en 
	p34l3	Grimmoch always seem to 
	p34l4	investigate the tomb with 
	p34l5	a scowling determination, 
	p34l6	Bergen seems to feel the 
	p34l7	same thrill of discovery 
	p34l8	as I. I am proud to now 
	p35l1	count him as a friend, 
	p35l2	and am thankful for his 
	p35l3	laughter as well as his 
	p35l4	strength.
	p35l5	Day Nine – Day Ten:
	p35l6	The excavation of the 
	p35l7	next set of tunnels has 
	p35l8	ceased, as three of the 
	p36l1	workers have gone missing 
	p36l2	in the night. Bergen 
	p36l3	voiced the opinion that 
	p36l4	they had most likely 
	p36l5	abandoned our group 
	p36l6	altogether and headed 
	p36l7	back, as they were of 
	p36l8	the number that seemed 
	p37l1	especially disturbed by the 
	p37l2	Tomb. Lysander had other 
	p37l3	ideas, however. In the 
	p37l4	middle of our discussion 
	p37l5	on the matter, he went 
	p37l6	into a wild tirade on the 
	p37l7	possibility that they had 
	p37l8	somehow infilitrated the 
	p38l1	tonb’s interior without 
	p38l2	us. The pure, hateful 
	p38l3	venom in his voice when 
	p38l4	he spoke of the workers 
	p38l5	shocked me, as I had 
	p38l6	always though(t) him to 
	p38l7	be a levelheaded man of 
	p38l8	great learning. As we are 
	p39l1	still at work digging out 
	p39l2	the rubble that blocks all 
	p39l3	access to the inner 
	p39l4	chanbers, I cannot help 
	p39l5	but believe the workers 
	p39l6	must have fled the site 
	p39l7	altogether, as Bergen 
	p39l8	said.
	p40l1	Day Eleven – Day 
	p40l2	Thirteen:
	p40l3	Two more workers have 
	p40l4	gone missing. Even more 
	p40l5	disturbing is the fact 
	p40l6	that Lysander has joined 
	p40l7	him. Late last night the 
	p40l8	workers finished 
	p41l1	excavating the next main 
	p41l2	hall, and we retired to 
	p41l3	the main antechamber and 
	p41l4	our camp to rest up for 
	p41l5	exploration on the 
	p41l6	‘morrow. In the middle 
	p41l7	of the night we woke to 
	p41l8	a strange howling sound, 
	p42l1	and as the men prepared 
	p42l2	themselves for another 
	p42l3	onslaught of the beasts 
	p42l4	that had troubled our 
	p42l5	outer camp, it was 
	p42l6	noticed that Lysander was 
	p42l7	nowhere in our number. I 
	p42l8	cannot fathom where he 
	p43l1	has gone – the newly 
	p43l2	revealed chamber holds no 
	p43l3	immediate egress, blocked 
	p43l4	again by piles of stone 
	p43l5	and rubble, and I cannot 
	p43l6	believe that Lysander, of 
	p43l7	all people, would have fled 
	p43l8	this site – indeed, he 
	p44l1	had lately grown almost 
	p44l2	fanatical in his work to 
	p44l3	discover more of the 
	p44l4	secrets barred to us by 
	p44l5	the consistently slow 
	p44l6	progress of excavating 
	p44l7	each new hallway. The 
	p44l8	men are at work even 
	p45l1	now, and as the ceaseless 
	p45l2	thumps and cracks of 
	p45l3	their picks reverberate 
	p45l4	throughout the entirety 
	p45l5	of the tomb, the dust 
	p45l6	continous to pour down 
	p45l7	from the ancient 
	p45l8	stonework above us like 
	p46l1	some horrible, eldritch 
	p46l2	curse upon us all.
	p46l3	Day Fourteen – Day 
	p46l4	Fifteen:
	p46l5	Lysander has returned… 
	p46l6	and yet, how can I 
	p46l7	describe the horror of 
	p46l8	it? He stands across the 
	p47l1	chamber from me even 
	p47l2	now, a changed man. His 
	p47l3	hair hangs in grimy knots 
	p47l4	across his face, his 
	p47l5	clothes filthy and torn in 
	p47l6	places… and the blood – 
	p47l7	covered in blood, his skin 
	p47l8	shining in scarlet 
	p48l1	reflections of the 
	p48l2	torchlight. He will let no 
	p48l3	one approach; a thick 
	p48l4	rusted dagger in his hand 
	p48l5	warding off any attempts 
	p48l6	to overcome him. And the 
	p48l7	blood, which runs down in 
	p48l8	great rivulets from his 
	p49l1	arms and hands – it is 
	p49l2	not his own, and this is 
	p49l3	enough to keep is at a 
	p49l4	wary distance. Morg 
	p49l5	Bergen wishes to subdue 
	p49l6	him quickly, but there is 
	p49l7	something in Lysander’s 
	p49l8	eyes – and I remember 
	p50l1	the power of his spells, 
	p50l2	even as he swings the 
	p50l3	jagged dagger back and 
	p50l4	forth in a wide swath 
	p50l5	before him. Something 
	p50l6	about the sight of it 
	p50l7	makes my stomach churn. 
	p50l8	Something has happened, 
	p51l1	something that changes 
	p51l2	everything. Lysander has 
	p51l3	lost his sanity to this 
	p51l4	tomb… or to something 
	p51l5	within it. Do we dare 
	p51l6	approach? We must make 
	p51l7	a decision soon.
	p51l8	
	p52l1	Day Sixteen:
	p52l2	Why do I write? I 
	p52l3	must… not so much 
	p52l4	because there must be 
	p52l5	some record of this… 
	p52l6	what’s happened here… 
	p52l7	as for my own sanity. 
	p52l8	The act of putting pen 
	p53l1	to paper calms me, 
	p53l2	focuses me, even in this 
	p53l3	madness. Lysander is 
	p53l4	dead. So many are dead. 
	p53l5	And we’re trapped here, 
	p53l6	trapped forever in this 
	p53l7	nightmare. He would not 
	p53l8	let us pass, wild in his 
	p54l1	psychosis, furious, 
	p54l2	spitting, covered in blood, 
	p54l3	he swung the ancient 
	p54l4	dagger at any who 
	p54l5	approached. He babbled 
	p54l6	incoherently, cursed at us, 
	p54l7	the most hateful curses, 
	p54l8	prophecy, doom upon us. 
	p55l1	Bergen would have none 
	p55l2	of it. Finally, he leapt at 
	p55l3	Lysander, his massive axe 
	p55l4	at his side. But he would 
	p55l5	not be the end of the 
	p55l6	mad mage... no... they 
	p55l7	were… those hands, 
	p55l8	covered in the dirt of 
	p56l1	the grave, maggots, filth. 
	p56l2	They rose up behind 
	p56l3	Lysander. That look of 
	p56l4	curiosity on the mage’s 
	p56l5	face as Bergen skidded 
	p56l6	to a halt…t’was almost 
	p56l7	a moment of sanity for 
	p56l8	him, surely, to attempt 
	p57l1	to comprehend what could 
	p57l2	have stopped the warrior 
	p57l3	in his tracks. And then 
	p57l4	they were upon him. 
	p57l5	Skeletal hands, arms, and 
	p57l6	faces with loose, 
	p57l7	corrupted flesh hanging 
	p57l8	from yellow bone. Inhuman, 
	p58l1	yet once human, 
	p58l2	staggering towards us as 
	p58l3	their companions tore at 
	p58l4	Lysander, coming towards 
	p58l5	us in droves. 
	p58l6	Day Sixteen Later
	p58l7	We Ran. What could we 
	p58l8	do? We ran back towards 
	p59l1	the entrance, cutting at 
	p59l2	them when we could. 
	p59l3	T’was a nightmare, and 
	p59l4	yet nothingto prepare us 
	p59l5	for what would come. We 
	p59l6	were almost there, the 
	p59l7	entrance to the abhorred 
	p59l8	crypt in sight. Then the 
	p60l1	earth shook with such a 
	p60l2	force that we were 
	p60l3	dropped to our hands and 
	p60l4	knees, stumbling in the 
	p60l5	darkness with those…. 
	p60l6	those things surely behind 
	p60l7	us. The noise of falling 
	p60l8	rock and crumbling stone 
	p61l1	drowned out our piteous 
	p61l2	cries. No sign of the 
	p61l3	entrance remained. We 
	p61l4	owe our lives to Bergen, 
	p61l5	whose wits returned 
	p61l6	quickly. That he could 
	p61l7	make us hurry back into 
	p61l8	the main antechamber…. 
	p62l1	actually run back towards 
	p62l2	those eldritch dead that 
	p62l3	stalked us. But we did, 
	p62l4	the strength of his 
	p62l5	convictions enough for us 
	p62l6	in the moment. And at 
	p62l7	our campsite we erected 
	p62l8	our last defense, a 
	p63l1	pitiable wall of wood and 
	p63l2	stone, anything at hand 
	p63l3	that might block the tide 
	p63l4	of those nightmare 
	p63l5	creatures. And I sit 
	p63l6	against it evennow. I can 
	p63l7	hear their moans, their 
	p63l8	wailing cries in the 
	p64l1	distance – they’ll be 
	p64l2	here soon, even at the 
	p64l3	unhurried pace of the 
	p64l4	shufflingdead.
	p64l5	Day Seventeen – Day 
	p64l6	Eighteen:
	p64l7	I cannot go on much 
	p64l8	longer. I know now t’was 
	p65l1	no work of the earth 
	p65l2	that trapped us here – 
	p65l3	I can feel His force in 
	p65l4	it. It was His will, His 
	p65l5	power that has sealed us 
	p65l6	in this nightmare. The 
	p65l7	barricade will not be 
	p65l8	enough. So many of them. 
	p66l1	They come like unto the 
	p66l2	ocean’s waves – 
	p66l3	ceaseless, neverending. For 
	p66l4	every five we strike 
	p66l5	down, another ten rise up 
	p66l6	against us. And like the 
	p66l7	sands we cannot help bu 
	p66l8	be brought down, wasted 
	p67l1	away in this ocean of 
	p67l2	blood.
	p67l3	Day Nineteen – Day 
	p67l4	Twenty-One:
	p67l5	The barricade won’t hold 
	p67l6	– never, and they’ll 
	p67l7	come, they come even 
	p67l8	now. I would tear the 
	p68l1	last of it down, let them 
	p68l2	in to devour us all, if 
	p68l3	only to stop the 
	p68l4	screaming – the awful, 
	p68l5	wailing cries that fill the 
	p68l6	tomb with their presence. 
	p68l7	May my ancestors forgive 
	p68l8	me, but it must be done. 
	p69l1	I must end this.

	title	Ethical Hedonism
	author	Richard Garriot
	p1l1	----An Introduction----
	p1l2	Societies oft have 
	p1l3	common codes of conduct 
	p1l4	which it [sic] expects all 
	p1l5	its people to abide by. 
	p1l6	Now, while ’tis true that 
	p1l7	this can offer some 
	p1l8	advantages, most of the 
	p2l1	codes I see today around 
	p2l2	Britannia have fatal 
	p2l3	flaws. Let us examine 
	p2l4	them.
	p2l5	
	p2l6	First, there is 
	p2l7	Blackthorn’s code of 
	p2l8	Chaos or basically 
	p3l1	Anarchy. Whereas this 
	p3l2	affords the individual 
	p3l3	maximum opportunity for 
	p3l4	individuality and eve [sic] 
	p3l5	pursuit of personal 
	p3l6	happiness, it does not 
	p3l7	offer even basic 
	p3l8	interpersonal conduct 
	p4l1	codes to prevent people 
	p4l2	from killing each other.
	p4l3	
	p4l4	Without such basic 
	p4l5	tenets, all the people will 
	p4l6	need to spend a 
	p4l7	significant portion of 
	p4l8	their time and effort 
	p5l1	towards personal 
	p5l2	protection and thus less 
	p5l3	time towards other more 
	p5l4	beneficial pursuits.
	p5l5	
	p5l6	Then there are the moral 
	p5l7	codes that are so popular 
	p5l8	today. These codes are 
	p6l1	built largely on historical 
	p6l2	tradition rather than 
	p6l3	current logic and thus 
	p6l4	are also antiquated. For 
	p6l5	example many moral codes 
	p6l6	we see today include 
	p6l7	statements about not 
	p6l8	eating certain foods that 
	p7l1	once were often 
	p7l2	poisonous, but today can 
	p7l3	be prepared safely.
	p7l4	
	p7l5	Many forbid contact 
	p7l6	between young people of 
	p7l7	the opposite gender, which 
	p7l8	can in fact be hazardous; 
	p8l1	but the codes often have 
	p8l2	lost the context as to 
	p8l3	why this is done, instead 
	p8l4	merely calling it amoral. 
	p8l5	In this day and age to 
	p8l6	call that a necessary 
	p8l7	moral would need a new 
	p8l8	reasoning. I put forth 
	p9l1	that tradition is not 
	p9l2	enough.
	p9l3	
	p9l4	Then there are Lord 
	p9l5	British’s Virtues. It 
	p9l6	strikes me that while a 
	p9l7	system of virtues is 
	p9l8	wonderful as a touchstone 
	p10l1	to guide a society to 
	p10l2	good behavior, these are 
	p10l3	but shades of the 
	p10l4	underlying truth as t 
	p10l5	[sic] why one may wish 
	p10l6	to live a life according 
	p10l7	to certain rules of 
	p10l8	conduct.
	p11l1	
	p11l2	On the other hand, 
	p11l3	clearly the Virtues that I 
	p11l4	have heard Lord British 
	p11l5	speak of are clearly 
	p11l6	positive codes of conduct, 
	p11l7	far better than the 
	p11l8	world of anarchy that 
	p12l1	Lord Blackthorn suggests. 
	p12l2	Yet, are not these 
	p12l3	Virtues still derived from 
	p12l4	a set of principles which 
	p12l5	though they sound good, 
	p12l6	are difficult to pin down 
	p12l7	as actual, undeniable, 
	p12l8	rational truths?
	p13l1	Worse yet though imagine 
	p13l2	a society who’s [sic] 
	p13l3	code of conduct was 
	p13l4	based on pure survival of 
	p13l5	the strongest. While this 
	p13l6	society may function and 
	p13l7	even accomplish much, it 
	p13l8	can be fairly argued that 
	p14l1	personal happiness would 
	p14l2	suffer greatly except for 
	p14l3	those at the top. To rule 
	p14l4	that out, however, we 
	p14l5	must first believe that 
	p14l6	people have a right to 
	p14l7	pursue happiness.
	p14l8	
	p15l1	I hope is [sic] a safe 
	p15l2	assumption that all beings 
	p15l3	wish to be happy; I will 
	p15l4	broadly describe this as 
	p15l5	Hedonism. Yet, if all 
	p15l6	people did is live a life 
	p15l7	of hedonism, their 
	p15l8	hedonism might be in 
	p16l1	conflict with those near 
	p16l2	them, so I will use the 
	p16l3	term Ethics to describe 
	p16l4	limits one might put on 
	p16l5	one’s hedonistic 
	p16l6	tendencies to allow others 
	p16l7	to pursue their happiness 
	p16l8	as well.
	p17l1	
	p17l2	Allow me to give this 
	p17l3	example: If one were to 
	p17l4	live alone on a desert 
	p17l5	isle, one could live a life 
	p17l6	of pure hedonism, for no 
	p17l7	action one might take 
	p17l8	could interfere with 
	p18l1	another’s right to pursue 
	p18l2	their happiness. Poison th 
	p18l3	[sic] lake if you like, 
	p18l4	ther [sic] is no one to 
	p18l5	blame but yourself!
	p18l6	
	p18l7	Now suppose two of you 
	p18l8	live on that island. Thou 
	p19l1	dost not want thy 
	p19l2	neighbor to feel free to 
	p19l3	poison the lake. Would it 
	p19l4	not be better to consider 
	p19l5	it unethical to poison th 
	p19l6	[sic] lake without first 
	p19l7	thinking of those whose 
	p19l8	pursuit of happiness might 
	p20l1	be affected by this 
	p20l2	action?
	p20l3	
	p20l4	I put forth that it is 
	p20l5	the fact that we as a 
	p20l6	people choose to live in 
	p20l7	groups known as a 
	p20l8	society that causes us to 
	p21l1	compromise our pure 
	p21l2	hedonism with logical 
	p21l3	ethics. Likewise we accept 
	p21l4	not being able to kill 
	p21l5	others without reason, 
	p21l6	because our own pursuit 
	p21l7	of happiness would be 
	p21l8	greatly interfered with if 
	p22l1	we feared others would 
	p22l2	do the same to us. From 
	p22l3	this basis of logic can be 
	p22l4	formed the Tenets of 
	p22l5	Ethical Hedonism.
	p22l6	
	p22l7	For more on this subject, 
	p22l8	see the Tenants [sic] of 
	p23l1	Ethical Hedonism, by 
	p23l2	Richard Garriott and 
	p23l3	Herman Miller.

	p1l1	I have done as my 
	p1l2	Master has instructed 
	p1l3	me.
	p1l4	
	p1l5	The painted humans 
	p1l6	have been driven into 
	p1l7	Britannia and are even 
	p1l8	now wreaking havoc 
	p2l1	across the land, providing 
	p2l2	us with the distraction 
	p2l3	my Master requested. We 
	p2l4	have
	p2l5	provided them with the 
	p2l6	masks necessary to 
	p2l7	defeat the orcs, thus 
	p2l8	causing even more 
	p3l1	distress for the people 
	p3l2	of Britannia. The 
	p3l3	unsuspecting fools are too 
	p3l4	busy dealing with the orc 
	p3l5	hordes to
	p3l6	continue their exploration 
	p3l7	of our lands. We are 
	p3l8	safe…for now.
	p4l1	The attacks continue 
	p4l2	exactly as planned. My 
	p4l3	Master is pleased with 
	p4l4	my work and we are 
	p4l5	closer to our goals than 
	p4l6	ever before.
	p4l7	The gargoyles have proven 
	p4l8	to be more troublesome 
	p5l1	than we first anticipated, 
	p5l2	but I believe we can 
	p5l3	subjugate them fully given 
	p5l4	enough time. It’s 
	p5l5	unfortunate that we did 
	p5l6	not discover
	p5l7	their knowledge sooner. 
	p5l8	Even now they prepare 
	p6l1	our armies for battle, 
	p6l2	but not without 
	p6l3	resistance. Now that 
	p6l4	some of them know of 
	p6l5	the other lands and of 
	p6l6	humans, they will double 
	p6l7	their
	p6l8	efforts to seek help. This 
	p7l1	cannot be allowed.
	p7l2	
	p7l3	Damn them!! The 
	p7l4	humans proved more 
	p7l5	resourceful than we 
	p7l6	thought them capable of. 
	p7l7	Already their homes are 
	p7l8	free of orcs and savages 
	p8l1	and they once again are 
	p8l2	treading in our
	p8l3	lands. We may have to 
	p8l4	move sooner than we 
	p8l5	thought. I will prepare my 
	p8l6	brethren and our golems. 
	p8l7	Hopefully, we can buy our 
	p8l8	Master some more time 
	p9l1	before the humans 
	p9l2	discover us.
	p9l3	
	p9l4	It's too late. The 
	p9l5	gargoyles who have evaded 
	p9l6	our capture have opened 
	p9l7	the doors to our land. 
	p9l8	They pray the humans will 
	p10l1	help them, despite the 
	p10l2	actions of their
	p10l3	cousins in Britannia. I 
	p10l4	fear they are right. I 
	p10l5	must go to warn the 
	p10l6	master…

	p1l1	The Campaign to slaughter 
	p1l2	the meer goes well. 
	p1l3	Although they seem to 
	p1l4	oppose the forces of 
	p1l5	ours at every turn, we 
	p1l6	still defeat them in 
	p1l7	combat. Spies of the 
	p1l8	Meer have been found and 
	p2l1	slain outside of the 
	p2l2	fortress of ours. The 
	p2l3	fools underestimate us. 
	p2l4	We have the power of 
	p2l5	Lord Exodus behind us. 
	p2l6	Soon they will learn to 
	p2l7	serve the Juka and I 
	p2l8	shall carry the head of 
	p3l1	the wench, Dasha, for all 
	p3l2	warriors to share triumph 
	p3l3	under.
	p3l4	
	p3l5	One of the warriors of 
	p3l6	the Juka died today. 
	p3l7	During the training of 
	p3l8	ours he spoke out in 
	p4l1	favor of the warriors of 
	p4l2	the Meer, saying that 
	p4l3	they were indeed powerful 
	p4l4	and would provide a 
	p4l5	challenge to the Juka. A 
	p4l6	Juka in fear is no Juka. 
	p4l7	I gave him death of a 
	p4l8	coward outside 
	p5l1	battle.More spies of the 
	p5l2	Meer have been found 
	p5l3	around the fortress of 
	p5l4	ours. Many have been 
	p5l5	seen and escaped warriors 
	p5l6	of ours. Those who have 
	p5l7	been captured and 
	p5l8	tortured have revealed 
	p6l1	nothing to us, even when 
	p6l2	subject to the spells of 
	p6l3	the females. I know the 
	p6l4	Meer must have plans 
	p6l5	against us if they send 
	p6l6	so many spies. I may 
	p6l7	send troops of the juka 
	p6l8	to invade the camp of 
	p7l1	theirs as a warning.
	p7l2	
	p7l3	I have met Dasha in 
	p7l4	battle this day. The 
	p7l5	efforts of her to draw 
	p7l6	me into a black duel were 
	p7l7	foolish. Had we not been 
	p7l8	interrupted in the cave I 
	p8l1	would have ended the life 
	p8l2	of hers but that will 
	p8l3	have to wait for another 
	p8l4	battle. Lord Exodus 
	p8l5	ordered more patrols 
	p8l6	around the fortress of 
	p8l7	ours. If Dasha is any 
	p8l8	indication strike soon.
	p9l1	More Meer stood outside 
	p9l2	the fortress of ours 
	p9l3	then i have ever seen at 
	p9l4	once. They must seek 
	p9l5	vengeance for the 
	p9l6	devastation of their 
	p9l7	forrest. Many Juka stand 
	p9l8	ready at the base of the 
	p10l1	mounatain to face the 
	p10l2	forces of theirs but 
	p10l3	today may be the final 
	p10l4	battle. Exodus has 
	p10l5	summoned me, I must 
	p10l6	prepare.
	p10l7

	p11l1	Dusk has passed and the 
	p11l2	Juka now live in a new 
	p11l3	age, a later time. I have 
	p11l4	just returned from 
	p11l5	exploring the new world 
	p11l6	that surrounds the 
	p11l7	fortress of the Juka. 
	p11l8	During the attack of the 
	p12l1	meer the madman 
	p12l2	Adranath tried to destroy 
	p12l3	the fortress of ours 
	p12l4	with great magic. At once 
	p12l5	he was still and light 
	p12l6	surrounded the fortress. 
	p12l7	Everything faded from 
	p12l8	view. When i regained the 
	p13l1	senses of mine I saw no 
	p13l2	sign of the Meer but 
	p13l3	Dasha. She has not been 
	p13l4	found since this new 
	p13l5	being, Blackthorn, blasted 
	p13l6	her from the top of the 
	p13l7	fortress.The forrest was 
	p13l8	gone, now replaced by 
	p14l1	grasslands. In the far 
	p14l2	distance i could see 
	p14l3	humans that had covered 
	p14l4	the bodies of theirs in 
	p14l5	marks. Even Gargoyles 
	p14l6	populated this place. 
	p14l7	Exodus has explained to 
	p14l8	me that the Juka and 
	p15l1	the fortress of ours had 
	p15l2	been pulled forward in 
	p15l3	time. The world we knew 
	p15l4	is now a thousand years 
	p15l5	in the past. Lord Exodus 
	p15l6	says he has saved the 
	p15l7	Juka from extinction, I 
	p15l8	do not want to believe 
	p16l1	him. I asked this stranger 
	p16l2	about the Meer but he 
	p16l3	tells me a new enemy 
	p16l4	remains to be destroyed. 
	p16l5	It seems the enemies of 
	p16l6	ours have passed away to 
	p16l7	dust like the forrest.

	p1l1	Day One:
	p1l2	At last, it stands before 
	p1l3	me. The doors of Thy 
	p1l4	Sanctum will open to me 
	p1l5	now, after all these 
	p1l6	years of searching. I give 
	p1l7	myself unto thee, Khal 
	p1l8	Ankhur, I have come for 
	p2l1	Thy secrets and I will 
	p2l2	kneel prostrate before 
	p2l3	Thee, Blessed are the 
	p2l4	Keepers, praise unto thee, 
	p2l5	a thousand fortunes in 
	p2l6	the night.
	p2l7	Day Two:
	p2l8	The woman, Tavara Sewel, 
	p3l1	is unbearable. Her entire 
	p3l2	demeanor sickens me. I 
	p3l3	would take her life for 
	p3l4	Thee now, my Lord. But I 
	p3l5	cannot alert the others. 
	p3l6	Progress is made too 
	p3l7	slowly, I cannot wait this 
	p3l8	perpetual waiting. Today I 
	p4l1	knelt down with the 
	p4l2	workers, tossing stones 
	p4l3	and dirt aside with my 
	p4l4	very hands as they dug 
	p4l5	all the last of the rubble 
	p4l6	covering the entrance to 
	p4l7	Thy Sanctum. The Sewel 
	p4l8	woman was shocked at my 
	p5l1	demeanor, dirtying my 
	p5l2	robes on my knees in the 
	p5l3	muck as I clawed at the 
	p5l4	rocks. She thought I did 
	p5l5	this for those sickly 
	p5l6	scholars, or for her, or 
	p5l7	for what she laughably 
	p5l8	calls ‘The Gift of 
	p6l1	Discovery’, of learning. 
	p6l2	As if I did not know 
	p6l3	what I went to find! I 
	p6l4	come for Thee, Master. 
	p6l5	Soon shall I receive Thy 
	p6l6	gifts, Thy blessings. 
	p6l7	Patience, eternal patience. 
	p6l8	I must take my lessons 
	p7l1	well. I have learned from 
	p7l2	Thee, Master, I have.
	p7l3	Day Three – Day Six:
	p7l4	What are these Beasts 
	p7l5	that dare to defy our 
	p7l6	presence here? Hast Thou 
	p7l7	sent them, Master? To 
	p7l8	tear apart these foolish 
	p8l1	ones that accompany me? 
	p8l2	That repugant pustule, 
	p8l3	Drummel, put forth his 
	p8l4	absurd little theories as 
	p8l5	to the nature of the 
	p8l6	Beasts that attacked our 
	p8l7	camp, but I’ll have none 
	p8l8	of his words. He asks 
	p9l1	too many questions. He is 
	p9l2	taint upon the grounds of 
	p9l3	Thy Sanctum, Master – I 
	p9l4	will deal with him after 
	p9l5	the Sewel woman. 
	p9l6	Speaking of Sewel, I have 
	p9l7	convinced that 
	p9l8	empty-headed harlot that 
	p10l1	we should move our 
	p10l2	encampement within the 
	p10l3	antechamber. She thinks I 
	p10l4	worry for her safety. I 
	p10l5	come for thee, Master. I 
	p10l6	make my camp in thy 
	p10l7	chambers. I sleep under 
	p10l8	Thy roof. I can feel Thine 
	p11l1	presence even now. Soon, 
	p11l2	Master. Soon.
	p11l3	Day Seven:
	p11l4	The Sewel woman 
	p11l5	pratters on endlessly. And 
	p11l6	she dares to speak Thy 
	p11l7	Name, Master! I wish so 
	p11l8	vehemently to take a 
	p12l1	knife to that little neck 
	p12l2	of hers. She struts 
	p12l3	around the chambers of 
	p12l4	Thy Sanctum with her 
	p12l5	repugnant airs, her 
	p12l6	scholarly conjecture on 
	p12l7	this or that. That I could 
	p12l8	peel the skin from her 
	p13l1	face and show her how 
	p13l2	vile and ugly she truly is, 
	p13l3	how unworthy of entrance 
	p13l4	to Thy Sanctum. I must 
	p13l5	take her, Master. I must 
	p13l6	rend that little wench to 
	p13l7	pieces. I ask this gift of 
	p13l8	Thee, that I might cleanse 
	p14l1	Thy Sanctum of her 
	p14l2	presence. Give me the 
	p14l3	Sewel woman and I shall 
	p14l4	show you my mastery of 
	p14l5	Death, Master. I shall cut 
	p14l6	her to bits and scatter 
	p14l7	them before the others 
	p14l8	as a warning. I cannot 
	p15l1	stand her presence, I 
	p15l2	cannot abide it. And 
	p15l3	Drummel! He is a pustule 
	p15l4	that must be lanced, a 
	p15l5	sickness that I must cure 
	p15l6	by blade and fire. Not a 
	p15l7	trace of him will be left 
	p15l8	when I’m done with him. 
	p16l1	Praises to Thee, Master. 
	p16l2	I shall honor Thee with 
	p16l3	many sacrifices, soon 
	p16l4	enough.
	p16l5	Day Eight – Day Ten:
	p16l6	Have you taken them, 
	p16l7	Master ? They could not 
	p16l8	have found a way past 
	p17l1	the stones that block our 
	p17l2	path! The three workers, 
	p17l3	My Master, where have 
	p17l4	they gone ? Curses upon 
	p17l5	them! I’ll cut them all to 
	p17l6	pieces if they show their 
	p17l7	faces again, then burn 
	p17l8	the rest alive upon a 
	p18l1	pyre, for all to see, as a 
	p18l2	warning of Thy Power. 
	p18l3	How could they have 
	p18l4	gotten past me ? I sleep 
	p18l5	against the very walls, to 
	p18l6	hear Thy Words, to feel 
	p18l7	Thy Breath. I can find no 
	p18l8	egress from the chambers 
	p19l1	that the Sewel woman 
	p19l2	does not know of not 
	p19l3	have men working at 
	p19l4	excavating. Where have 
	p19l5	they gone, Master ? Have 
	p19l6	you taken them, or do 
	p19l7	they truly flee from Thy 
	p19l8	Presence ? I will kill 
	p20l1	them if they show their 
	p20l2	faces again. Give me 
	p20l3	Strength, my Master, to 
	p20l4	let them live a while 
	p20l5	longer, until they have 
	p20l6	fulfilled their purpose and 
	p20l7	I kneel before Thee, 
	p20l8	covered in their blood.
	p21l1	Day Eleven – Day 
	p21l2	Thirteen:
	p21l3	I come for Thee, my 
	p21l4	Master. I come! The way 
	p21l5	is clear, I have found Thy 
	p21l6	path and washed it in the 
	p21l7	blood of the two workers 
	p21l8	that caught sight of me. 
	p22l1	Ah, how sweet it was to 
	p22l2	cut them open, to see 
	p22l3	the blood pour out in 
	p22l4	great torrents, to stand 
	p22l5	in it, to revel in it. If 
	p22l6	only I had time for the 
	p22l7	Sewel woman. But there 
	p22l8	will be time enough for 
	p23l1	her. I have learned Thy 
	p23l2	Patience, Master. I come 
	p23l3	for Thee. I walk thy halls 
	p23l4	in penance, my last steps 
	p23l5	in this repulsive living 
	p23l6	frame. I come for Thee 
	p23l7	and Thy Gifts my Master. 
	p23l8	Glory Unto Thee, Khal 
	p24l1	Ankur, Keeper of the 
	p24l2	Seventh Death, Master, 
	p24l3	Leader of the Chosen, 
	p24l4	the Khaldun. Praises in 
	p24l5	Thy Name, Master of 
	p24l6	Life and Death, Lord of 
	p24l7	All. Khal Ankur, Master, 
	p24l8	Prophet, I join Thy ranks 
	p25l1	this night, a member of 
	p25l2	the Khaldun at last.

	title	My Book
	author	Sherrie the Mouse
	p1l1	'Twas on a chill night, 
	p1l2	when the moon shone 
	p1l3	pasty-faced above the 
	p1l4	horizon, balanced on the 
	p1l5	towers of Lord British’s 
	p1l6	castle, that the events I 
	p1l7	am about to r.aatelate 
	p1l8	took place, some years 
	p2l1	ago now. I witnessed them 
	p2l2	all from my tiny 
	p2l3	mousehole.
	p2l4	Milords British and 
	p2l5	Blackthron are accustomed 
	p2l6	to a game of chess 
	p2l7	‘pon an evening, over 
	p2l8	which they argue the 
	p3l1	issues that affect the 
	p3l2	course of the realm. Lord 
	p3l3	Blackthorn was on his 
	p3l4	way to Lord British’s 
	p3l5	chambers, and Lord 
	p3l6	British stood by a window 
	p3l7	casement, just having 
	p3l8	finished setting the pieces 
	p4l1	upon the board.
	p4l2	
	p4l3	Suddenly the shutters 
	p4l4	blew open, and Lord 
	p4l5	British fell to the 
	p4l6	ground, one hand shileding 
	p4l7	his eyes. A chill wind 
	p4l8	entered the room, and it 
	p5l1	seemd a gash was torn in 
	p5l2	the very air. Through the 
	p5l3	gas I could see stars and 
	p5l4	swirling clouds of stellar 
	p5l5	dust, and a coldness 
	p5l6	sucked all the warmth 
	p5l7	from the air. A terrible 
	p5l8	wind tossed books and 
	p6l1	blankets across the room, 
	p6l2	and furniture toppled.
	p6l3	
	p6l4	From within this gash 
	p6l5	issued a great voice, 
	p6l6	unlike any I have ever 
	p6l7	heard. And these are the 
	p6l8	words it spoke (for I 
	p7l1	memorized them most 
	p7l2	carefully):
	p7l3	
	p7l4	“Greetings, Lord British. 
	p7l5	I am the Time Lord, a 
	p7l6	being from beyond your 
	p7l7	dimension, as thou art 
	p7l8	from a world other than 
	p8l1	Sosaria. I am here to 
	p8l2	bring thee warning. Dost 
	p8l3	thou recall how long ago 
	p8l4	mysterious Stranger came 
	p8l5	to Sosaria and saved the 
	p8l6	world from the evil 
	p8l7	wizard Mondain? He 
	p8l8	shattered the Gem of 
	p9l1	Immortality, within which 
	p9l2	dwelled a perfect likeness 
	p9l3	of this world.”
	p9l4	
	p9l5	Lord British slowly stood 
	p9l6	and faced the hole in the 
	p9l7	air. “I remember,” he 
	p9l8	said. “Oft have I wished 
	p10l1	that stranger would 
	p10l2	return.”
	p10l3	
	p10l4	“He hath returned,” 
	p10l5	spoke the voice. “But 
	p10l6	not to here. When the 
	p10l7	Gem was shattered, a 
	p10l8	thousand shards were 
	p11l1	scattered across the 
	p11l2	dimensions, and in each 
	p11l3	shard there is a perfect 
	p11l4	likeness of this world. 
	p11l5	And thou dost live upon 
	p11l6	one such shard, for thou 
	p11l7	art not of the true 
	p11l8	world-thou art merely a 
	p12l1	reflection.”
	p12l2	
	p12l3	Lord British looked shaken 
	p12l4	by this, and I did not 
	p12l5	know what to think! Was 
	p12l6	I merely a shadow of the 
	p12l7	real me, which lives still 
	p12l8	somewhere else across 
	p13l1	uncounted universes?
	p13l2	
	p13l3	“My task is to heal 
	p13l4	this shattered world, Lord 
	p13l5	British,” said the voice. 
	p13l6	“And I seek to enlist 
	p13l7	thee in my cause. Be 
	p13l8	warned that in this case, 
	p14l1	healing carries with it a 
	p14l2	terrible price.”
	p14l3	
	p14l4	Concern warred with 
	p14l5	curiosity on my liege’s 
	p14l6	face, but ever one to 
	p14l7	shoulder a burden, he 
	p14l8	straightened and faced 
	p15l1	the gash in the air 
	p15l2	bravely. “Name thy 
	p15l3	price.”
	p15l4	
	p15l5	“A shard of a universe 
	p15l6	is a powerful thing, and 
	p15l7	universe shattered is 
	p15l8	always in danger from 
	p16l1	the powers of darkness. 
	p16l2	Already three shards 
	p16l3	were turned to evil, and 
	p16l4	sent to plague the 
	p16l5	original universe in the 
	p16l6	form of Shadowlords. 
	p16l7	Many times have I 
	p16l8	brought the Stranger 
	p17l1	back to Britannia, to 
	p17l2	preserve it from its own 
	p17l3	folly or from outside 
	p17l4	dangers. Yet as long as 
	p17l5	the world remaineth in 
	p17l6	pieces, it remaineth 
	p17l7	vulnerable. We must bring 
	p17l8	the shards into harmony, 
	p18l1	so that they resonate in 
	p18l2	such a manner that 
	p18l3	matches the original 
	p18l4	universe. Then the two 
	p18l5	universes shall merge, and 
	p18l6	be again as one.
	p18l7	
	p18l8	
	p19l1	“But if we are only 
	p19l2	shadows…” Lord British 
	p19l3	said wonderingly.
	p19l4	
	p19l5	The light from the stars 
	p19l6	within the hole seemed to 
	p19l7	dim. “Indeed, the 
	p19l8	reflections shall become 
	p20l1	one with the orginal. Thou 
	p20l2	wouldst cease to be as 
	p20l3	thou art, and become 
	p20l4	part of the larger you. 
	p20l5	Thou shalt not die; 
	p20l6	however, uncounted 
	p20l7	generations have passed 
	p20l8	and borne children since 
	p21l1	that day, and they have 
	p21l2	no counterparts. They 
	p21l3	would perish utterly.” 
	p21l4	Lord British sagged in 
	p21l5	shock, realizing the 
	p21l6	terrible price that would 
	p21l7	be paid to heal the 
	p21l8	universe. “All of my 
	p22l1	people,” he breathed.
	p22l2	
	p22l3	“Tis for the greateer 
	p22l4	good.”
	p22l5	
	p22l6	Lord British bowed his 
	p22l7	head.
	p22l8	
	p23l1	‘Twas then I saw the 
	p23l2	movement by the door, 
	p23l3	half-hid by the heavy red 
	p23l4	curtains. Lord Blackthron 
	p23l5	stood there, concealed 
	p23l6	from the rest of the 
	p23l7	room, his face white. How 
	p23l8	long had he been 
	p24l1	listening? I cannot say, 
	p24l2	yet I suspect that he 
	p24l3	had heard all that the 
	p24l4	mysterious voice had to 
	p24l5	say.
	p24l6	
	p24l7	“How then, shall I aid 
	p24l8	thee?” Lord British said, 
	p25l1	weariness in his voice.
	p25l2	
	p25l3	“Aid the nobility that 
	p25l4	resideth in human heart. 
	p25l5	Protect the Virtues that 
	p25l6	so recently came to thee 
	p25l7	in thought late at night. 
	p25l8	They are the Virtues of 
	p26l1	life, as your counterpart 
	p26l2	understands them to be. 
	p26l3	For when thy populace 
	p26l4	doth live and breathe 
	p26l5	these Virtues shall it 
	p26l6	match the true Britannia, 
	p26l7	and thy shard shall rejoin 
	p26l8	with it.”
	p27l1	The gash in the air began 
	p27l2	to close, and with it 
	p27l3	warmth stole back into 
	p27l4	the room.
	p27l5	
	p27l6	“I was going to discuss 
	p27l7	my idea with Blackthorn 
	p27l8	tonight,” Lord British 
	p28l1	breathed. “Have I no 
	p28l2	thoughts that are my 
	p28l3	own? Is my life but a 
	p28l4	reflection of another 
	p28l5	me?”
	p28l6	
	p28l7	
	p28l8	
	p29l1	“Nay,” said the voice, 
	p29l2	smaller through the 
	p29l3	diminished opening. “Say, 
	p29l4	rather, that you are 
	p29l5	parallel, for there is no 
	p29l6	guarantee that thou shalt 
	p29l7	accomplish what I have 
	p29l8	set thee to. I speak 
	p30l1	tonight to a thousand of 
	p30l2	thee, and ask the same 
	p30l3	of all. Perhaps not all 
	p30l4	shall seek to aid me.” 
	p30l5	And with that, the gash 
	p30l6	closed, and the voice was 
	p30l7	gone, leaving a room that 
	p30l8	appeared tossed by a 
	p31l1	mighty storm.
	p31l2	
	p31l3	“Destroy the world to 
	p31l4	save the universe,” Lord 
	p31l5	British said bitterly. “I 
	p31l6	do not wonder that some 
	p31l7	may balk.”
	p31l8	
	p32l1	Lord Blackthorn collected 
	p32l2	himself, and strode into 
	p32l3	the room, a decent 
	p32l4	mimicry of surprise on 
	p32l5	his face. “My liege! 
	p32l6	What has happened 
	p32l7	here?” he exclaimed, 
	p32l8	feigning dismay well. But 
	p33l1	not well enough to fool 
	p33l2	his old friend, whose eyes 
	p33l3	narrowed at seeing him 
	p33l4	there.
	p33l5	
	p33l6	“How much didst thou 
	p33l7	hear?” Demanded Lord 
	p33l8	British.
	p34l1	“Why, nothing,” managed 
	p34l2	Blackthorn, his head 
	p34l3	ducked away from his 
	p34l4	friend, as he bent to 
	p34l5	retrieve the fallen chess 
	p34l6	pieces. “I merely came 
	p34l7	for our game of chess.”
	p34l8	
	p35l1	Together, they righted 
	p35l2	the table, and set the 
	p35l3	pieces upon the black and 
	p35l4	white squares. “Such 
	p35l5	simplicity to the game, 
	p35l6	Blackthorn,” mused Lord 
	p35l7	British, idly brushing one 
	p35l8	finger against the board. 
	p36l1	“Black and white, each 
	p36l2	to its own color, as if 
	p36l3	life were so simple. What 
	p36l4	think you?”
	p36l5	
	p36l6	Blackthorn sat heavily on 
	p36l7	a hassock beside the 
	p36l8	chess table. “I think 
	p37l1	that matters are never 
	p37l2	so simple, my liege. And 
	p37l3	that I would regret it 
	p37l4	deeply if someone, such 
	p37l5	as a friend, saw it 
	p37l6	thus.”
	p37l7	
	p37l8	
	p38l1	Lord British’s eyes met 
	p38l2	his. “Yet sometimes one 
	p38l3	must sacrifice a pawn to 
	p38l4	save a king.”
	p38l5	
	p38l6	Lord Blackthorn met his 
	p38l7	gaze squarely. “Even 
	p38l8	pawns have lives and 
	p39l1	loves at home, my lord.” 
	p39l2	Then he reached out for 
	p39l3	a pawn, and firmly moved 
	p39l4	it forward to squares. 
	p39l5	“Shall we play a 
	p39l6	game?” he asked.
	p39l7	
	p39l8	
	p40l1	The chess game that 
	p40l2	night was a draw, and 
	p40l3	they played grimly.
	p40l4	
	p40l5	And the next day, Lord 
	p40l6	British gathered the 
	p40l7	nobles to proclaim the 
	p40l8	idea of a new system of 
	p41l1	Virtues, and declared that 
	p41l2	shrines should be built 
	p41l3	across the land.
	p41l4	
	p41l5	Lord Blackthorn opposed 
	p41l6	it bitterly, and many 
	p41l7	thought him strange for 
	p41l8	doing so, for ever had he 
	p42l1	been a noble and upright 
	p42l2	man, and ever had he and 
	p42l3	Lord British been in 
	p42l4	accord. Declaring that he 
	p42l5	should start his own 
	p42l6	shrine, he departed the 
	p42l7	castle that day to live in 
	p42l8	a tower in a lake on the 
	p43l1	north side of the city.
	p43l2	
	p43l3	They are still the best 
	p43l4	of friends, yet a sadness 
	p43l5	hangs between them, as 
	p43l6	if they were forced into 
	p43l7	making choices that 
	p43l8	appealed not to them. 
	p44l1	And at night, when I 
	p44l2	creep softly from one 
	p44l3	corner of my liege’s 
	p44l4	bedchamber to another, I 
	p44l5	sometimes see him take a 
	p44l6	pawn from his night 
	p44l7	table, and hold it in his 
	p44l8	hand, and quietly weep.
	p45l1	But I am but a mouse, 
	p45l2	and none hear me. This 
	p45l3	tale goes unknown, save 
	p45l4	for my writing these 
	p45l5	enormous letters with 
	p45l6	mine ink-stained tiny paws 
	p45l7	for thee to read, for I 
	p45l8	fear indeed for our world 
	p46l1	and for our people in 
	p46l2	these perilous times.

	title	Our Land's Diversity
	author	Lord Blackthorn
	p1l1	On the Diversity of Our 
	p1l2	Land
	p1l3	While I deplore the 
	p1l4	depredations of the 
	p1l5	misguided and belligerent 
	p1l6	races wit(h) which we 
	p1l7	share our fair Britannia, 
	p1l8	and alongside the populace 
	p2l1	do mourn the needless 
	p2l2	deaths that their raids 
	p2l3	cause, I cannot 
	p2l4	countenance the policy of 
	p2l5	wholesale slaughter of 
	p2l6	these races that seems 
	p2l7	to be the habity of our 
	p2l8	soldierly element. Can we 
	p3l1	not regard the ratmen, 
	p3l2	lizard men, and orcs are 
	p3l3	fellow intelligent beings 
	p3l4	with whom we share a 
	p3l5	planet? Why must we 
	p3l6	slay them on sight, 
	p3l7	rather than attempt to 
	p3l8	engage them in dialogue? 
	p4l1	There is no policy of 
	p4l2	shooting at wisps when 
	p4l3	they grace us with their 
	p4l4	presence (not that an 
	p4l5	arrow could do much to 
	p4l6	pierce them!).
	p4l7	
	p4l8	To view these creatures 
	p5l1	as vermin denies their 
	p5l2	obvious intelligence, and 
	p5l3	we cannot underestimate 
	p5l4	the repercussions that 
	p5l5	their slaughter may have. 
	p5l6	If we regard the slaying 
	p5l7	of fellow humans as a 
	p5l8	crime, so must we regard 
	p6l1	the killing of an orc.
	p6l2	
	p6l3	At the same time, should 
	p6l4	a lizardman slay a human, 
	p6l5	whould we not forgive 
	p6l6	their ignorance and 
	p6l7	foolishness? Let us not 
	p6l8	surrender the high moral 
	p7l1	ground by descending to 
	p7l2	bestiality.
	p7l3	
	p7l4	Now, I say not that we 
	p7l5	should fail to defend 
	p7l6	ourselves in case of 
	p7l7	attack, for even amongst 
	p7l8	humans we see war, we 
	p8l1	see famine, and we see 
	p8l2	assault (though we owe a 
	p8l3	debt of gratitude to our 
	p8l4	Lord British for 
	p8l5	preserving us from the 
	p8l6	worst of these!). 
	p8l7	However, incursions such 
	p8l8	as the recent tragedy 
	p9l1	which cost us the life of 
	p9l2	Japheth, Guildmaster of 
	p9l3	Trinsic’s Paladins, are 
	p9l4	folly.
	p9l5	
	p9l6	I had met Japheth, and 
	p9l7	like all paladins, he burned 
	p9l8	with an inner fire. Yet 
	p10l1	though I had the utmost 
	p10l2	respect for him, none 
	p10l3	could deny the hatred 
	p10l4	that flashed in his eyes 
	p10l5	the mere mention of 
	p10l6	orcs. And thus he carried 
	p10l7	his battle to the orc 
	p10l8	camps, and died there, 
	p11l1	unable to rise above his 
	p11l2	own childhood experiences 
	p11l3	depicted in his book, 
	p11l4	“The Burning of 
	p11l5	Trinsic.” ‘Tis a shame 
	p11l6	that even our mightiest 
	p11l7	men fall prey to this 
	p11l8	ignorance!
	p12l1	Are there not legends of 
	p12l2	orcs adopting human 
	p12l3	children to raise as their 
	p12l4	own? Tales of complex 
	p12l5	societies built underground 
	p12l6	by races we regard as 
	p12l7	bestial?
	p12l8	
	p13l1	Let us not repeat the 
	p13l2	mistake of Japheth of 
	p13l3	the Paladins, and let us 
	p13l4	cease to persecute the 
	p13l5	nonhuman races, before 
	p13l6	we discover that we are 
	p13l7	harming ourselves in the 
	p13l8	process.

	title	Quest of the Virtues I
	author	Autenil
	p1l1	Volume I
	p1l2	Chapter 1: 
	p1l3	Starting out
	p1l4	I begin my Quest in the 
	p1l5	fine bank of Skara  
	p1l6	Brae.  My Quest is to 
	p1l7	travel by foot to the 
	p1l8	eight shrines of Britannia. 
	p2l1	 Although this may sound 
	p2l2	easy,  it is hampered 
	p2l3	because I have forsaken 
	p2l4	my abilities and worldly 
	p2l5	possessions.  Instead, all 
	p2l6	that I have to live by 
	p2l7	are a set of plain 
	p2l8	clothes, a ship to sail 
	p3l1	the seas and my diary in 
	p3l2	which to record my 
	p3l3	adventures.  Onward Ho 
	p3l4	towards the Shrine of 
	p3l5	Spirituality!
	p3l6	
	p3l7	Chapter 2:  The Road to 
	p3l8	Spirituality
	p4l1	Since I have forsaken 
	p4l2	magic as a form of 
	p4l3	travel, I must find a way 
	p4l4	to the mainland from this 
	p4l5	island town.  Fortunately 
	p4l6	I was able to barter a 
	p4l7	ride from the ferryman.  
	p4l8	Upon reaching the 
	p5l1	mainland, I followed the 
	p5l2	road until it turned 
	p5l3	North, yes I must 
	p5l4	continue Eastward.  I 
	p5l5	paused to listen to the 
	p5l6	pleasant sounds of the 
	p5l7	birds chirping and enjoyed 
	p5l8	the peace away from the 
	p6l1	busy life.  Upon reaching 
	p6l2	the Hedge Maze I recalled 
	p6l3	a story about the mage 
	p6l4	Relvinian in the days of 
	p6l5	old and turned South to 
	p6l6	go around it.  Possessing 
	p6l7	no weapons and having 
	p6l8	forsaken my training.  I 
	p7l1	heeded the sign that said, 
	p7l2	“Enter and Become One 
	p7l3	Among Ghosts.”  The 
	p7l4	River forced me to turn 
	p7l5	South and then continue 
	p7l6	East.
	p7l7	
	p7l8	
	p8l1	Chapter 3: Spirituality
	p8l2	Spirituality is the leader 
	p8l3	of the Virtues.  It is 
	p8l4	the meditation and 
	p8l5	understanding of all other 
	p8l6	 Virtues.  Without 
	p8l7	Spirituality, one cannot 
	p8l8	completely follow the 
	p9l1	Virtues, for it is the 
	p9l2	dedication and adherance 
	p9l3	to them.
	p9l4	
	p9l5	Chapter 4: Finding Honor
	p9l6	My next visit will be to 
	p9l7	the Shrine of Honor, 
	p9l8	which lies a fair distance 
	p10l1	to the South.  there is 
	p10l2	a road to my East that 
	p10l3	I will follow to the town 
	p10l4	of Trinsic.  I found a 
	p10l5	warm room at the 
	p10l6	Traveller’s Inn, and woke 
	p10l7	refreshed in the morning 
	p10l8	to hear the sounds of 
	p11l1	nature as I prepared to 
	p11l2	continue my journeys.  I 
	p11l3	thanked the kind innkeeper 
	p11l4	and headed out of Trinsic 
	p11l5	and South.  I conversed 
	p11l6	briefly with one lucky 
	p11l7	enough to own a house in 
	p11l8	the beautiful country and 
	p12l1	he bade me good fortune 
	p12l2	on my travels.  I used 
	p12l3	my rusty blade to cut 
	p12l4	through dense jungles 
	p12l5	past ruins of a forgotten 
	p12l6	realm, now inhabited only 
	p12l7	by the Undead.  Many a 
	p12l8	mongbat did hamper my 
	p13l1	journey, but finally I 
	p13l2	arrived at the Shrine of 
	p13l3	Honor.
	p13l4	
	p13l5	Chapter 5: Honor
	p13l6	Many link Honor and 
	p13l7	battle, but it can be 
	p13l8	used with any aspect of 
	p14l1	Life.  Honor is to abide 
	p14l2	by the rules, dishonor is 
	p14l3	to cheat: to seek the 
	p14l4	unfair advantage.  I 
	p14l5	vowed to alway live life 
	p14l6	with Honor.
	p14l7	
	p14l8	
	p15l1	Chapter 6: Seeking Valor
	p15l2	I must now embark on my 
	p15l3	trusty small ship, the 
	p15l4	Hollandia, to the South 
	p15l5	and East,  to a small 
	p15l6	island where few have 
	p15l7	travelled.  I know not yet 
	p15l8	what I will encounter at 
	p16l1	sea, so I bid the Virtues 
	p16l2	grant me safety.  So 
	p16l3	begins my voyage.  I 
	p16l4	managed to sail unnoticed 
	p16l5	past some water 
	p16l6	elementals which took a 
	p16l7	fair bit of navigation 
	p16l8	from my tillerman.  
	p17l1	However, I arrived without 
	p17l2	incident.
	p17l3	
	p17l4	Chapter 7: Valor
	p17l5	The Shrine of Valor is 
	p17l6	protected by many a 
	p17l7	beast far too poisonous 
	p17l8	and foul for myself to 
	p18l1	vanquish.  One must show 
	p18l2	Valor to approach the 
	p18l3	Shrine!  Valor is often 
	p18l4	shown in one’s willingness 
	p18l5	to fight what maybe a 
	p18l6	losing battle upon which 
	p18l7	he believes.  It takes 
	p18l8	Valor to stand your 
	p19l1	ground against the many 
	p19l2	murderers and lawbreakers 
	p19l3	in our lands.  You may 
	p19l4	lose, but you show Valor 
	p19l5	in that you fight that 
	p19l6	which must be opposed.  
	p19l7	Fight the fights you 
	p19l8	believe in, not just the 
	p20l1	fights you think you can 
	p20l2	win.
	p20l3	
	p20l4	Chapter 8: The voyage to 
	p20l5	Humility
	p20l6	My journey will continue 
	p20l7	to the East towards the 
	p20l8	Shrine of Humility.  I 
	p21l1	launch my boat from the 
	p21l2	West side of the Island 
	p21l3	of Valor, where I made 
	p21l4	my daring escape from 
	p21l5	the many Giant Serpents 
	p21l6	chasing me with their 
	p21l7	poisonous venom and 
	p21l8	hissing tongues.  Beautiful 
	p22l1	blue waves washed over 
	p22l2	the bow of the boat as 
	p22l3	dolphins played, merrily 
	p22l4	leading me on.  The 
	p22l5	voyage is long and the 
	p22l6	water turbulent but 
	p22l7	finally land was struck.  
	p22l8	Quickly I ran, eager to 
	p23l1	find my final destination 
	p23l2	for the day.
	p23l3	
	p23l4	Chapter 9: Humility
	p23l5	The Shrine of Humility is 
	p23l6	surprisingly spartan; it is 
	p23l7	merely a grove of stone 
	p23l8	pillars with an ankh and 
	p24l1	the Humility stone at its 
	p24l2	center.  I would 
	p24l3	characterize Humility as 
	p24l4	this Quest; returning to 
	p24l5	my roots in this world.  
	p24l6	I have rejected my 
	p24l7	possessions and my wealth 
	p24l8	in order to rely  only 
	p25l1	upon my cunning and 
	p25l2	instincts.  No longer have 
	p25l3	I that which makes me 
	p25l4	Glorious to others, but I 
	p25l5	have only that which I 
	p25l6	need to survive.  I may 
	p25l7	no longer rely upon 
	p25l8	myself, I must rely upon 
	p26l1	others for my survival.  
	p26l2	My journey to Humility 
	p26l3	has only made me realise 
	p26l4	even more how Blessed I 
	p26l5	have been.
	p26l6	
	p26l7	
	p26l8	
	p27l1	Chapter 10: Onward to 
	p27l2	Honesty
	p27l3	Now the journey will turn 
	p27l4	South towards the Island 
	p27l5	of Ice.  However, my 
	p27l6	voyages and excursions 
	p27l7	into the jungle have made 
	p27l8	me quite tired, so I will 
	p28l1	camp here beside a river 
	p28l2	near the Shrine of 
	p28l3	Humility for the night.  I 
	p28l4	awake the next morning 
	p28l5	refreshed and invigorated, 
	p28l6	but also under attack!  A 
	p28l7	Headless One has noticed 
	p28l8	my rise from slumber and 
	p29l1	attacks me viciously.  My 
	p29l2	trusty cleaver was in my 
	p29l3	hand instantly but my 
	p29l4	lack of skill with the 
	p29l5	weapon delayed the death 
	p29l6	of the creature.  I 
	p29l7	launched the Hollandia and 
	p29l8	set sail for the Island of 
	p30l1	Ice, seeking the Shrine of 
	p30l2	Honesty.  As I sail the 
	p30l3	vast oceans, I find myself 
	p30l4	desiring the company of 
	p30l5	my fellow man.  Hopefully 
	p30l6	I shall meet some kind of 
	p30l7	traveller with whom I may 
	p30l8	exchange a few words.  
	p31l1	Shortly I was landing my 
	p31l2	boat on the North end of 
	p31l3	the Island of Ice. I 
	p31l4	quickly made my way 
	p31l5	through snow across the 
	p31l6	frigid tundra while trying 
	p31l7	to keep warm.  The 
	p31l8	Shrine of Honesty bid me 
	p32l1	welcome as I felt the 
	p32l2	warmth radiate throughout 
	p32l3	me.
	p32l4	
	p32l5	Chapter 11: Honesty
	p32l6	Honesty is to uphold and 
	p32l7	defend he truth at all 
	p32l8	times.  Furthermore, 
	p33l1	Honesty requires us to 
	p33l2	be fair and true to our 
	p33l3	fellow man; not taking 
	p33l4	undue advantage.  Honesty 
	p33l5	is a Virtue often lacking 
	p33l6	in today’s world.  It 
	p33l7	seems as though people 
	p33l8	are out to gain wealth 
	p34l1	with no regard to 
	p34l2	Honesty towards other 
	p34l3	people.  Honesty is the 
	p34l4	foundation upon which 
	p34l5	trust is built.  If the

	p34l7	everything build upon it

	p35l3	a testament to its value 
	p35l4	in today’s society.  the 
	p35l5	symbolic cold and secluded 
	p35l6	location show us that

	p1l1	Volume II
	p1l2	Chapter 13: Sacrifice
	p1l3	“The courage to give of 
	p1l4	oneself in the name of 
	p1l5	love.”  Usually you give 
	p1l6	something that you hold 
	p1l7	dear to help out someone 
	p1l8	in need.   Whether this 
	p2l1	is giving gold or 
	p2l2	equipment to a young 
	p2l3	adventurer or giving up 
	p2l4	fame to release a 
	p2l5	creature from bondage, 
	p2l6	Sacrifice is an action 
	p2l7	that should always come 
	p2l8	from the heart.  the 
	p3l1	Ankh of Sacrifice is 
	p3l2	stained red with the 
	p3l3	blood of those who have 
	p3l4	given their lives to help 
	p3l5	others.  Beautiful flowers 
	p3l6	abound as loved ones 
	p3l7	honor the graves of the 
	p3l8	ones they hold dear.  
	p4l1	May we all be ready and 
	p4l2	willing to sacrifice that 
	p4l3	which is important to 
	p4l4	ourselves to help those 
	p4l5	less fortunate.

	p5l1	Chapter 14: Highway to 
	p5l2	Compassion
	p5l3	The Shrine of Sacrifice 
	p5l4	is located a fair distance 
	p5l5	Northeast of the 
	p5l6	beautiful seatown of 
	p5l7	Vesper.  Tonight I will 
	p5l8	stay in the Ironwood Inn 
	p6l1	on the Southwest corner 
	p6l2	of Vesper.  I wake up 
	p6l3	refreshed and eager to 
	p6l4	continue my journey.  I 
	p6l5	thank the innkeeper for 
	p6l6	my fine room and head 
	p6l7	West out of town 
	p6l8	towards the Shrine of 
	p7l1	Compassion.  Through 
	p7l2	peaceful forests I came 
	p7l3	and stopped fast at the 
	p7l4	desert of Compassion.  
	p7l5	Crossing this lake of 
	p7l6	sand teaming with 
	p7l7	venomous and foul 
	p7l8	creatures would be 
	p8l1	difficult at best.  The 
	p8l2	temptation to tame a 
	p8l3	few Giant Scorpions to 
	p8l4	protect me was 
	p8l5	overwhelming, but would 
	p8l6	violate the Rules of my 
	p8l7	Quest.  I grab my 
	p8l8	cleaver from my backpack 
	p9l1	in an attempt to scare 
	p9l2	away the beasts with its 
	p9l3	menaciing stare.  So as 
	p9l4	thus I set foot into this 
	p9l5	wasteland of sand, praying 
	p9l6	to the gods to assist me 
	p9l7	in my dash to the Shrine 
	p9l8	of Compassion.  Although 
	p10l1	snakes were easily 
	p10l2	dispatched with my 
	p10l3	cleaver (even with my 
	p10l4	lack of skill with the 
	p10l5	blade), Sand Vortexes 
	p10l6	were more of a problem.  
	p10l7	Many times did they 
	p10l8	chase me away and 
	p11l1	quickly did they follow me 
	p11l2	across the sand. T’would 
	p11l3	be a game of cunning to 
	p11l4	reach my beloved Shrine.  
	p11l5	finally the cursed Sand 
	p11l6	Vortex was dumbfounded 
	p11l7	as to reaching me 
	p11l8	through the house blocking 
	p12l1	his way.  A snake gave a 
	p12l2	good fight by biting me 
	p12l3	and injecting his venom.  
	p12l4	I showed Compassion upon 
	p12l5	the creature and allowed 
	p12l6	it to leve as I ran 
	p12l7	quickly to my destination, 
	p12l8	the Shrine of Compassion.
	p13l1	Chapter 15: Compassion
	p13l2	Compassion is to bestow 
	p13l3	aid upon those less 
	p13l4	fortunate than you are.  
	p13l5	I cannot help but think 
	p13l6	of the many prisoners I 
	p13l7	have encountered in the 
	p13l8	wild, bound by a savage 
	p14l1	band of orcs or bandits.  
	p14l2	May we all strive to help 
	p14l3	those in need, those that 
	p14l4	we can help.  For 
	p14l5	someday we may be in 
	p14l6	need ourselves and will 
	p14l7	undoubtedly desire 
	p14l8	Compassion from our 
	p15l1	fellow man.
	p15l2	
	p15l3	Chapter 16: Following the 
	p15l4	Way of Justice
	p15l5	The Shrine of Justice, 
	p15l6	my final destination, lies 
	p15l7	further West of 
	p15l8	Compassion.  Eager to 
	p16l1	complete my journey, I 
	p16l2	travel on, the excitement 
	p16l3	of impending completion 
	p16l4	causing me to forget my 
	p16l5	weariness.  Out of sheer 
	p16l6	curiosity I paid a visit to 
	p16l7	the Shrine of Chaos, a 
	p16l8	foul place for only the 
	p17l1	evil.  No more will I 
	p17l2	speak of it here.  Along 
	p17l3	the road I came across a 
	p17l4	fellow traveler who goes 
	p17l5	by the name of Dexter.  
	p17l6	After speaking with him 
	p17l7	for a good time I told 
	p17l8	him of my Quest and my 
	p18l1	desire for Knighthood 
	p18l2	within my Guild.  I bade 
	p18l3	him to seek out the 
	p18l4	Virtues ans wished him 
	p18l5	good day as I continued 
	p18l6	on my Quest.  My steps 
	p18l7	turned North through 
	p18l8	dense forestry as I seek 
	p19l1	Justice.  The Shrine of 
	p19l2	Justice was guarded by a 
	p19l3	Troll, an Ogre and a 
	p19l4	Headless One.  Far more 
	p19l5	than a match for me and 
	p19l6	my poor cleaver. I must 
	p19l7	pay my devotion quickly 
	p19l8	and run from these 
	p20l1	bloodthirsty foes.
	p20l2	
	p20l3	Chapter 17: Justice
	p20l4	In today’s world it seems 
	p20l5	as though more and more 
	p20l6	people are turning to the 
	p20l7	mindless slaying of 
	p20l8	innocents for pleasure.  
	p21l1	We who are innocent 
	p21l2	must take great offense 
	p21l3	at this and stand up for 
	p21l4	what is right.  These 
	p21l5	murderers should be 
	p21l6	brought to swift justice 
	p21l7	and their possessions 
	p21l8	given to the poor for 
	p22l1	their crimes.  As I was 
	p22l2	telling Dexter, I could not 
	p22l3	bring myself to slay an 
	p22l4	innocent without 
	p22l5	provocation.  It’s just 
	p22l6	not who I am.  I love 
	p22l7	the truth of goodness 
	p22l8	and must uphold it, taking 
	p23l1	up arms if necessary.
	p23l2	
	p23l3	Chapter 18: The Journey 
	p23l4	Home
	p23l5	So from this final Shrine 
	p23l6	I turn my road Southward 
	p23l7	back to the town of 
	p23l8	Skara Brae, for there 
	p24l1	will my Quest be 
	p24l2	complete.  The road from 
	p24l3	the Shrine of Justice to 
	p24l4	Skara Brae is quite long. 
	p24l5	Through dense forests 
	p24l6	and over long winding 
	p24l7	roads is the journey 
	p24l8	travelled.  Finally I 
	p25l1	arrived back at the bank 
	p25l2	of Skara Brae.  It is 
	p25l3	here that I pen this final 
	p25l4	chapter of my Quest.  
	p25l5	May those that read this 
	p25l6	Journal gain knowledge of 
	p25l7	the Virtues and strive to 
	p25l8	follow them in their 
	p26l1	actions and life.  If this 
	p26l2	is to be your Quest as 
	p26l3	well.  I wish you godspeed 
	p26l4	and safe journeys.

	title	Regarding Llamas
	author	Simon Sammartine
	p1l1	Llamas are curious 
	p1l2	beasts, shaggy and sought 
	p1l3	after for their wool, yet 
	p1l4	of a curiously arrogant 
	p1l5	disposition reflected in 
	p1l6	their eyes. They live in 
	p1l7	mountainous areas, though 
	p1l8	who may have first 
	p2l1	tamed them is lost in 
	p2l2	the mists of history.
	p2l3	
	p2l4	‘Tis a well-known fact 
	p2l5	that llamas can indeed be 
	p2l6	tamed, and used as 
	p2l7	grazing animals, for their 
	p2l8	meat, and of course for 
	p3l1	their wool. Yet ’tis 
	p3l2	lesser known that their 
	p3l3	ornery disposition and 
	p3l4	tendency to spit at those 
	p3l5	they dislike makes them 
	p3l6	appealing guard creatures 
	p3l7	as well, though they have 
	p3l8	little sound with which to 
	p4l1	sound an alarum.

	title	Talking to Wisps
	author	Heigel of Moonglow
	p1l1	This volume was sponsored 
	p1l2	by donations from Lord 
	p1l3	Blackthorn, ever a 
	p1l4	supporter of 
	p1l5	understanding the other 
	p1l6	sentient races of 
	p1l7	Britannia.
	p1l8	
	p2l1	Wisps are the most 
	p2l2	intelligent of the 
	p2l3	nonhuman races inhabiting 
	p2l4	Britannia. ‘Tis claimed 
	p2l5	by the great sages that 
	p2l6	someday we shall be able 
	p2l7	to converse with them 
	p2l8	openly in our native 
	p3l1	tongue — indeed, we 
	p3l2	must hope that wisps 
	p3l3	learn our language, for it 
	p3l4	is not possible for 
	p3l5	humans to pronounce 
	p3l6	wispish!
	p3l7	
	p3l8	
	p4l1	The wispish language 
	p4l2	seems to only contain one 
	p4l3	vowel, the letter Y. 
	p4l4	However, the letters W, 
	p4l5	C, M, and L seem to be 
	p4l6	treated grammatically as 
	p4l7	vowels, and in addition 
	p4l8	every letter is followed 
	p5l1	by what sounds to the 
	p5l2	human ear like a glottal 
	p5l3	stop. It is possible that 
	p5l4	the glottal stop is 
	p5l5	considered a vowel as 
	p5l6	well.
	p5l7	
	p5l8	Wisps do make use of 
	p6l1	what sounds to us like 
	p6l2	pitch and emphasis shifts 
	p6l3	similar to exclamations 
	p6l4	and questions.
	p6l5	
	p6l6	The average word in 
	p6l7	wispish seems to consist 
	p6l8	of three phonemes and 
	p7l1	three glottal stops, plus 
	p7l2	possibly a pitch shift. It 
	p7l3	often sounds burning or 
	p7l4	crackling. Some have 
	p7l5	speculated that what we 
	p7l6	are analyzing is in fact 
	p7l7	nothing more than the 
	p7l8	very air crackling near 
	p8l1	the wisp’s glow, and not 
	p8l2	language, but this is of 
	p8l3	course unlikely.The average

	title	Taming Dragons
	author	Wyrd Beastmaster
	p1l1	I have not much to tell 
	p1l2	about dragons. The sole 
	p1l3	time I approached one 
	p1l4	with an eye towards 
	p1l5	taming it, my initial 
	p1l6	attempts at calming it 
	p1l7	met with failure. It fixed 
	p1l8	a massive beady eye upon 
	p2l1	me, and began its 
	p2l2	slithering approach, 
	p2l3	intending no doubt to 
	p2l4	insert me into its maw 
	p2l5	and bear down with its 
	p2l6	teeth.
	p2l7	
	p2l8	
	p3l1	However, as I was 
	p3l2	engaged in what remains 
	p3l3	to this day the most 
	p3l4	terrifying combat of my 
	p3l5	life, the dragon suddenly 
	p3l6	whirled as if in a panic, 
	p3l7	ran a short distance, 
	p3l8	took off into the air, 
	p4l1	then transformed into a 
	p4l2	whirlwind. Lastly, it 
	p4l3	exploded, showering gouts 
	p4l4	of black blood and 
	p4l5	heaving, stinking flesh 
	p4l6	upon miles of countryside. 
	p4l7	The fireball was massive 
	p4l8	enough to light a city I 
	p5l1	should surmise.
	p5l2	
	p5l3	I never did discover the 
	p5l4	exact cause of this 
	p5l5	strange behavior except 
	p5l6	to assume that it was 
	p5l7	not typical for this 
	p5l8	reptilian species. My best 
	p6l1	guesses revolve around a 
	p6l2	magical fracture in the 
	p6l3	nature of reality, which 
	p6l4	is far too esoteric a 
	p6l5	territory for one of my 
	p6l6	limited scholarship.
	p6l7	
	p6l8	Hence my basic advice to 
	p7l1	those who seek to tame 
	p7l2	a dragon-be sure that 
	p7l3	thou hast mastered the 
	p7l4	twin skills of taming 
	p7l5	animals, and running away 
	p7l6	very fast.

	title	The Bold Stranger
	author	Old Fabio the Poor
	p1l1	In a time before time, 
	p1l2	the Gods that Be 
	p1l3	assembled a group of 
	p1l4	artisans, craftsmen and 
	p1l5	lore masters (for, yes, 
	p1l6	even in those days, art 
	p1l7	existed) to create the 
	p1l8	world of Sosaria. To this 
	p2l1	group, the gods gave a 
	p2l2	tiny world, Rytabul, in 
	p2l3	which to test their 
	p2l4	works, to see if they 
	p2l5	were of the quality 
	p2l6	desired for the true 
	p2l7	world in which they would 
	p2l8	be placed. And though the 
	p3l1	gods were tight fisted 
	p3l2	with their gold, this small 
	p3l3	crew worked hard and 
	p3l4	long, and were happy in 
	p3l5	their tasks.
	p3l6	A small corner of Rytabul 
	p3l7	had been claimed by the 
	p3l8	artisan Selrahc the Slow. 
	p4l1	Though he was not the 
	p4l2	fastest of the assembled 
	p4l3	workers, the gods smiled 
	p4l4	upon his work, even 
	p4l5	presenting him with a 
	p4l6	mystic talisman 
	p4l7	proclaiming his work the 
	p4l8	best among the newer 
	p5l1	artisans. And so Selrahc 
	p5l2	went about his business, 
	p5l3	creatin (sic) hundreds of 
	p5l4	designs which would one 
	p5l5	day add color and variety 
	p5l6	to Sosaria.
	p5l7	One day a stranger 
	p5l8	appeared to Selrahc. His 
	p6l1	chest was bare and he 
	p6l2	wore the trousers of the 
	p6l3	brightest green, and 
	p6l4	wherever he went, plants 
	p6l5	grew in his footsteps. 
	p6l6	This caused Selrahc no en 
	p6l7	(sic) of trouble, the 
	p6l8	stranger always looking 
	p7l1	over his shoulder, and the 
	p7l2	plants sprouting in places 
	p7l3	Selrahc required to ply 
	p7l4	his art. And so Selrahc 
	p7l5	approached the stranger 
	p7l6	and bade him speak. But 
	p7l7	this man in green 
	p7l8	remained silent. Selrahc 
	p8l1	pleaded with the stranger 
	p8l2	to give his name, and 
	p8l3	would he please leave 
	p8l4	Selrahc to his work. But 
	p8l5	this mysterious stranger 
	p8l6	remained mute.
	p8l7	This angered Selrahc 
	p8l8	mightily. Who was this 
	p9l1	silent man, interfering 
	p9l2	with tasks the gods 
	p9l3	themselves had entrusted 
	p9l4	to Selrahc? In an 
	p9l5	attempt to embarass this 
	p9l6	interloper, Selrahc stole 
	p9l7	his green trousers, leaving 
	p9l8	him naked and open to 
	p10l1	comments about his very 
	p10l2	manhood, and still the 
	p10l3	stranger would not speak, 
	p10l4	would not leave this tiny 
	p10l5	corner of Rytabul.
	p10l6	Vexed to his very limits, 
	p10l7	Selrahc took his war axe 
	p10l8	and smote the silent one 
	p11l1	mightily, again and again, 
	p11l2	until the silent stranger 
	p11l3	ran away, having never 
	p11l4	said a word, and never 
	p11l5	showed himself in Rytabul 
	p11l6	again.
	p11l7	Thus endeth the tale of 
	p11l8	the bold stranger.

	title	The Burning of Trinsic
	author	Paladin Japheth
	p1l1	Twas a sight to see, the 
	p1l2	sunlight falling lightly on 
	p1l3	the sandstone walls of 
	p1l4	Trinsic ‘pon a morning 
	p1l5	in spring.
	p1l6	Children ran along the 
	p1l7	parapets and walkways, 
	p1l8	their laughter and running 
	p2l1	providing music to the 
	p2l2	daybreak, despite their 
	p2l3	oft-ragged clothing.
	p2l4	The guards who maintained 
	p2l5	a vigilant outlook from 
	p2l6	atop the towers would 
	p2l7	smile indulgently as 
	p2l8	children slammed into 
	p3l1	their armored legs and 
	p3l2	brushed past them.
	p3l3	And I was one of those 
	p3l4	young ones, letting my 
	p3l5	joy rise up to the skies.
	p3l6	Little did we all know of 
	p3l7	the darker days that 
	p3l8	would lie ahead, for we 
	p4l1	were too young.
	p4l2	Had we but gained access 
	p4l3	to the quiet coucils held 
	p4l4	in the Paladin tower as 
	p4l5	it faced the sea, councils 
	p4l6	lit by candlelight and 
	p4l7	worry, we would have 
	p4l8	learned more of the 
	p5l1	fears of imminent attack 
	p5l2	from the forest, where 
	p5l3	foul creatures born of 
	p5l4	dank caves and darkness 
	p5l5	were marauding ever more 
	p5l6	often into the lands 
	p5l7	around Trinsic’s moat.
	p5l8	But we were children! The 
	p6l1	parapets and the moat 
	p6l2	were places to play, not 
	p6l3	stout defenses, and we 
	p6l4	gave no thought to the 
	p6l5	necessities that must 
	p6l6	have required their 
	p6l7	construction.
	p6l8	We used to reach the 
	p7l1	sheltered orchards on the 
	p7l2	lee side of the parapet 
	p7l3	walls, where the southern 
	p7l4	river cut through the 
	p7l5	city, by swimming across 
	p7l6	the water.
	p7l7	The rich folk who lived in 
	p7l8	the great manses there 
	p8l1	would shout from their 
	p8l2	windows and shake their 
	p8l3	fists, for we would run 
	p8l4	through their gardens and 
	p8l5	tear up the delicate 
	p8l6	foxgloves and orfleurs 
	p8l7	with our unshod dirty 
	p8l8	feet.
	p9l1	Then we would dive into 
	p9l2	the water and splash 
	p9l3	merrily to the fruit 
	p9l4	trees.
	p9l5	The southern river lazily 
	p9l6	slid under an ungated 
	p9l7	arch in the mighty wall, 
	p9l8	and we would lay on the 
	p10l1	grassy bank and watch it 
	p10l2	gurgle by the lily pads.
	p10l3	That spring that pleasant 
	p10l4	spot became the doorway 
	p10l5	through which our city of 
	p10l6	Trinsic let in the 
	p10l7	monstrous deformed 
	p10l8	humanoids that savaged 
	p11l1	us.
	p11l2	I lay upon that grassy 
	p11l3	bank and watched them 
	p11l4	wade in, their coarse hair 
	p11l5	wet and matted, algae 
	p11l6	and muck festooning their 
	p11l7	wild brows. They caught 
	p11l8	sight of a quicksilver girl 
	p12l1	with bright blond hair and 
	p12l2	lively eyes. Her name was 
	p12l3	Leyla and that spring I 
	p12l4	had held fond dreams of 
	p12l5	holding her hand and 
	p12l6	sharing flavored ice while 
	p12l7	dangling our feet off the 
	p12l8	small bridge by Smugglers 
	p13l1	Gate.
	p13l2	And I said nothing when 
	p13l3	they caught her, and did 
	p13l4	not cry out when they 
	p13l5	dragged her off through 
	p13l6	that breach in our wall, 
	p13l7	and did not warn the city 
	p13l8	when I saw the helmeted 
	p14l1	orc captains call the 
	p14l2	charge upon the mansions.
	p14l3	Blame me not, for I was 
	p14l4	but a child, and one who 
	p14l5	hid in the branches of 
	p14l6	the peach trees, all 
	p14l7	a-tremble whilst I 
	p14l8	watched the smoke rise 
	p15l1	from Sean the tailor’s, 
	p15l2	and fire lash out at the 
	p15l3	roof of witchy Eleanor’s 
	p15l4	tavern.
	p15l5	To this day I have had 
	p15l6	no word of Leyla, and to 
	p15l7	this day the smell of 
	p15l8	burning wood can conjure 
	p16l1	terrible dreams. Yet with 
	p16l2	the eyes of adulthood, 
	p16l3	’tis possible to examine 
	p16l4	the flaws in the defense 
	p16l5	of Trinsic on that fateful 
	p16l6	day, and the reasons why 
	p16l7	our walls are now 
	p16l8	double-thick, and why our 
	p17l1	buildings are now built as 
	p17l2	fortresses within a 
	p17l3	somber fortified city.
	p17l4	While I can look out 
	p17l5	from the top of the new 
	p17l6	Paladin tower, and spy 
	p17l7	the mighty white sails 
	p17l8	across the barrier island, 
	p18l1	and can descry the small 
	p18l2	hollow south of the city 
	p18l3	where gypsies are wont 
	p18l4	to camp, I can also 
	p18l5	envision the city as it 
	p18l6	might be burning, and I 
	p18l7	bless the bargain we 
	p18l8	made: space for safety, 
	p19l1	grace for sturdiness and 
	p19l2	wood for stone.
	p19l3	Whilst I live, I shall not 
	p19l4	see Trinsic burn, and no 
	p19l5	more cries of little girls 
	p19l6	will haunt the sleep of 
	p19l7	our fair citizens.
	p19l8	This is mine oath, as I 
	p20l1	live and breath.

	p1l2	Grimmoch Drumme
	p1l3	
	p1l4	Day One:
	p1l5	‘Tis a grand sight, this 
	p1l6	primeval tomb, I agree 
	p1l7	with Tavara on that. And 
	p1l8	we’ve a good crew here, 
	p2l1	they’ve strong backs and 
	p2l2	a good attitude. I’m a 
	p2l3	bit concerned by those 
	p2l4	that worked as guides 
	p2l5	for us, however. All 
	p2l6	seemed well enough until 
	p2l7	we revealed the immense 
	p2l8	stone doors of the tomb 
	p3l1	structure itself. Seemed 
	p3l2	to send a shiver up their 
	p3l3	spines and get them all 
	p3l4	stirred up with 
	p3l5	whispering. I’ll watch the 
	p3l6	lot of them with a close 
	p3l7	eye, but I’m confidant we 
	p3l8	won’t have any real 
	p4l1	problems on the dig. I’m 
	p4l2	especially proud to see 
	p4l3	Thomas standing out – 
	p4l4	he was a good hire 
	p4l5	despite the warnings from 
	p4l6	his previous employers. 
	p4l7	He’s drummed up the 
	p4l8	workers into a furious 
	p5l1	pace – we’ve nearly 
	p5l2	halved the estimate on 
	p5l3	the timeline for 
	p5l4	excavating he Tomb’s 
	p5l5	entrance.
	p5l6	Day Two:
	p5l7	We managed to dig out 
	p5l8	the last of the remaining 
	p6l1	rubble today , revealing 
	p6l2	the entirety of the giant 
	p6l3	stone doors that sealed 
	p6l4	ol Khal Ankur and his 
	p6l5	folks up ages ago. 
	p6l6	Actually getting them 
	p6l7	open was another matter 
	p6l8	altogether, however. As 
	p7l1	the workers set to the 
	p7l2	task with picks and 
	p7l3	crowbars, I could have 
	p7l4	sworn I saw Lysander 
	p7l5	Gathenwale fiddling with 
	p7l6	something in that musty 
	p7l7	old tome of his. I’ve no 
	p7l8	great knowledge of things 
	p8l1	magical, but the way his 
	p8l2	hand moved over that 
	p8l3	book, and the look of 
	p8l4	concentration on his face 
	p8l5	as he whispered something 
	p8l6	to himself looked like 
	p8l7	every description of an 
	p8l8	incantation I’ve ever 
	p9l1	heard. The strange thing 
	p9l2	is, this set of doors 
	p9l3	that an entire crew of 
	p9l4	excavators was laboring 
	p9l5	over for hours, right 
	p9l6	then when Gathenwale 
	p9l7	finishes with his 
	p9l8	mumbling… well I swore 
	p10l1	the doors just gave open 
	p10l2	at the exact moment he 
	p10l3	spoke his last bit of 
	p10l4	whisper and shut the 
	p10l5	tome tight in his hands. 
	p10l6	When he looked up, it 
	p10l7	was almost as if hew 
	p10l8	was expecting the doors 
	p11l1	to be open, rather than 
	p11l2	shocked that they’d 
	p11l3	finally given way.
	p11l4	Day Three – Day Five:
	p11l5	I might have written too 
	p11l6	hastily in my first entry 
	p11l7	– this place doesn’t 
	p11l8	seem too bent on giving 
	p12l1	up any secrets. Though 
	p12l2	the main antechamber is 
	p12l3	open to us, the main exit 
	p12l4	hall is blocked by yet 
	p12l5	another pile of rubble. 
	p12l6	Doesn’t look a bit like 
	p12l7	anything caused by a 
	p12l8	quake or instability in the 
	p13l1	stonework… I swear it 
	p13l2	looks as if someone 
	p13l3	actually piled the stones 
	p13l4	up themselves, some time 
	p13l5	after the tomb was built. 
	p13l6	The stones aren’t of 
	p13l7	thesame set nor quality 
	p13l8	of the carved work that 
	p14l1	surrounds them – if 
	p14l2	anything, they resemble 
	p14l3	the grade of common 
	p14l4	rock we saw in great 
	p14l5	quantities on the trip 
	p14l6	here. Which makes it feel 
	p14l7	all the more like someone 
	p14l8	hauled them in andcovered 
	p15l1	this passage. But then 
	p15l2	why not decorate them in 
	p15l3	the same ornate manner 
	p15l4	as the rest of the stone 
	p15l5	in this place? Lysander 
	p15l6	wouldn’t hear a work of 
	p15l7	what I had to say – to 
	p15l8	him, it was a quake 
	p16l1	sometime in the history 
	p16l2	of thetomb, and that was 
	p16l3	it, shut up and move on. 
	p16l4	So I shut up, and got 
	p16l5	back to work.
	p16l6	Day Six:
	p16l7	The camp was attacked 
	p16l8	last night by a pack of, 
	p17l1	well, I don’t have a clue. 
	p17l2	I’ve never seen the likes 
	p17l3	of these beasts anywhere. 
	p17l4	Huge things, with fangs 
	p17l5	the size of your 
	p17l6	forefinger, covered in hair 
	p17l7	and with the strangest 
	p17l8	arched back I’ve ever 
	p18l1	seen. And so many of 
	p18l2	them. We were forced 
	p18l3	back into the Tomb for 
	p18l4	the night, just to keep 
	p18l5	our hides on us. And 
	p18l6	today Gathenwale 
	p18l7	practically orders us all 
	p18l8	to move the entire 
	p19l1	exterior camp into the 
	p19l2	Tomb. Now, I don’t 
	p19l3	disagree that we’d be 
	p19l4	well off to use the place 
	p19l5	as a point of 
	p19l6	fortification… but I 
	p19l7	don’t like it one bit, in 
	p19l8	anycase. I don’t like the 
	p20l1	looks of this place, nore 
	p20l2	the sound of it. The way 
	p20l3	the wind gets into the 
	p20l4	passageways, whistling up 
	p20l5	the strangest noises. 
	p20l6	Deep, sustained echoes of 
	p20l7	the wind, not so much 
	p20l8	flute-like as…well, it 
	p21l1	sounds ridiculous. In any 
	p21l2	case, we’ve set to work 
	p21l3	moving the bulk of the 
	p21l4	exterior camp into the 
	p21l5	main antechamber so 
	p21l6	there’s no moaning about 
	p21l7	it now.
	p21l8	
	p22l1	Day Seven – Day Ten:
	p22l2	I cannot stand this place, 
	p22l3	I cannot bear it. I’ve got 
	p22l4	to get out. Something 
	p22l5	evil lurks in this ancient 
	p22l6	place, something best left 
	p22l7	alone. I hear them, yet 
	p22l8	none of the others do. 
	p23l1	And yet they must. 
	p23l2	Hands, claws, scratching 
	p23l3	at stone, the awful 
	p23l4	scratching and the piteous 
	p23l5	cries that sound almost 
	p23l6	like laughter. I can hear 
	p23l7	them above even the 
	p23l8	cracks of the workmen’s 
	p24l1	picks, and at night they 
	p24l2	are all I can hear. And 
	p24l3	yet the others hear 
	p24l4	nothing. We must leave 
	p24l5	this place, we must. 
	p24l6	Three workers have gone 
	p24l7	missing – Tavara expects 
	p24l8	they’ve abandoned us – 
	p25l1	and I count them lucky if 
	p25l2	they have. I don’t care 
	p25l3	what the others say, we 
	p25l4	must leave this place. We 
	p25l5	must do as those before 
	p25l6	and pile up the stones, 
	p25l7	block all access to this 
	p25l8	primeval crypt, seal it up 
	p26l1	again for all eternity.
	p26l2	Day Eleven – Day 
	p26l3	Thirteen:
	p26l4	Lysander is gone, and two 
	p26l5	more workers with him. 
	p26l6	Good riddance to the 
	p26l7	first. He knows 
	p26l8	something. He heard them 
	p27l1	too, I know he did – and 
	p27l2	yet he scowled at me 
	p27l3	when I mentioned them. I 
	p27l4	cannot stop the noise in 
	p27l5	my head, the scratching, 
	p27l6	the clawing tears at my 
	p27l7	senses. What is it? What 
	p27l8	does Lysander seek that I 
	p28l1	can only turn from? 
	p28l2	Where has he gone? The 
	p28l3	only answer to my 
	p28l4	questions comes as 
	p28l5	laughter from behind the 
	p28l6	stones.
	p28l7	Day Fourteen – Day 
	p28l8	Sixteen
	p29l1	We are lost … we are 
	p29l2	lost … all is lost. The 
	p29l3	dead are piled up at my 
	p29l4	feet. Bergen and I 
	p29l5	managed somehow in the 
	p29l6	madness to piece together 
	p29l7	a barricade, barring 
	p29l8	access to the camp 
	p30l1	antechamber. He knows as 
	p30l2	well as I that we cannot 
	p30l3	hold it forever. The dead 
	p30l4	come. They took Lysander 
	p30l5	before our eyes. I pity 
	p30l6	the soul of even such a 
	p30l7	madman – no one should 
	p30l8	die in such a manner. And 
	p31l1	yet so many have. We’re 
	p31l2	trapped in this horror. 
	p31l3	So many have died, and 
	p31l4	for what? What curse 
	p31l5	have we stumbled upon? I 
	p31l6	cannot bear it, the 
	p31l7	moaning, wailing cries of 
	p31l8	the dead. Poor Thomas, 
	p32l1	cut to pieces by their 
	p32l2	blades. We had only an 
	p32l3	hour to properly bury 
	p32l4	those we could, before 
	p32l5	the undead legions struck 
	p32l6	again. I cannot go on… I 
	p32l7	cannot go on.
	p32l8	
	p33l1	Day Seventeen – Day 
	p33l2	Twenty-Two:
	p33l3	The fighting never 
	p33l4	ceases… the blood never 
	p33l5	stop flowing, like a river 
	p33l6	through the bloated 
	p33l7	corpses of the dead. And 
	p33l8	yet there are still more. 
	p34l1	Always more, with the 
	p34l2	red fire gleaming in their 
	p34l3	eyes. My arm aches, I’v 
	p34l4	taken to the sword as 
	p34l5	my bow seems to do 
	p34l6	little good… the dull 
	p34l7	ache in my arm… so 
	p34l8	many swings, cleavig a 
	p35l1	mountain of decaying 
	p35l2	flesh. And Thomas… he 
	p35l3	was there, in the thick 
	p35l4	of it.. Thomas was beside 
	p35l5	me… his face cleaved in 
	p35l6	twain – and yet beside 
	p35l7	me, fighting with us 
	p35l8	against the horde until he 
	p36l1	was cut down once again. 
	p36l2	And I swear I see him 
	p36l3	even now, there in the 
	p36l4	dark corner of the 
	p36l5	antechamber, his eyes 
	p36l6	flickering in the last 
	p36l7	dying embers of the 
	p36l8	fire… and he stares at 
	p37l1	me, and a scream fills 
	p37l2	the vault – wheather his 
	p37l3	or mine, I can no longer 
	p37l4	tell.
	p37l5	Day Twenty-Three:
	p37l6	We no longer bury the 
	p37l7	dead.

	title	The Fight
	author	M. De La Garza
	p1l1	A cold autumn morning 
	p1l2	with misty fog secures a 
	p1l3	dozen brave knights, 
	p1l4	supplying hidden shelter 
	p1l5	from prying eyes deep in 
	p1l6	the foothills of the 
	p1l7	vibrant valley. Dragons 
	p1l8	soar like fierce warriors, 
	p2l1	circling around and around, 
	p2l2	then roaring like thunder, 
	p2l3	rallying all that listen. 
	p2l4	The dragons land swiftly 
	p2l5	beside the proud warriors, 
	p2l6	bending necks and 
	p2l7	extending wings, lifting 
	p2l8	black claws and allowing 
	p3l1	valiant fighters to ride 
	p3l2	forth and win an arisen 
	p3l3	battle. The increasing 
	p3l4	winds silence the sounds 
	p3l5	of combat, and they 
	p3l6	fight, standing their 
	p3l7	ground like mothers 
	p3l8	protecting their children, 
	p4l1	bright armor flashing as 
	p4l2	each one falls.
	p4l3	
	p4l4	A cold autumn’s evening 
	p4l5	with misty fog cradles a 
	p4l6	dozen battered corpses of 
	p4l7	knights, creasing them in 
	p4l8	currents of winds that 
	p5l1	run deep in the foothills 
	p5l2	of the desolate valley. 
	p5l3	Dragons glide like silent 
	p5l4	angels, circling around and 
	p5l5	around, then calling like 
	p5l6	banshees; keening cries of 
	p5l7	mourning. The dragons 
	p5l8	land heavily beside the 
	p6l1	peaceful bodies, bending 
	p6l2	their necks and extending 
	p6l3	wings, lifting black claws 
	p6l4	and pinching the sacred 
	p6l5	ground and new eternal 
	p6l6	home. The dying winds 
	p6l7	whistle among the dead in 
	p6l8	somber procession, and 
	p7l1	they lie, grasping weapons 
	p7l2	to protect themselves like 
	p7l3	knights still in battle, 
	p7l4	shattered armor shining 
	p7l5	like newly born stars.

	title	Traveling Minstrel's Life
	author	Sarah of Yew
	p1l1	The Life of a Traveling 
	p1l2	Minstrel
	p1l3	While ’tis true that the 
	p1l4	musician who seeketh only 
	p1l5	to make sweet music for 
	p1l6	herself and for others 
	p1l7	needs little more than 
	p1l8	some talent, and stern 
	p2l1	practice at the chosen 
	p2l2	instrument those of us 
	p2l3	who seek the open road 
	p2l4	shall find indeed that a 
	p2l5	greater skill is required. 
	p2l6	Herein discover those 
	p2l7	secrets which I have 
	p2l8	learned over the years as 
	p3l1	an itinerant performer..
	p3l2	Once I was in Jhelom, 
	p3l3	and accidently angered the 
	p3l4	bravo of some local 
	p3l5	repute, whose blade 
	p3l6	flickered all too eagerly 
	p3l7	near my slender neck (for 
	p3l8	I was young then). After 
	p4l1	various threats to “ruin 
	p4l2	my pretty face” this 
	p4l3	bravo grabbed my arm in 
	p4l4	a most unseemly fashion 
	p4l5	and tossed me into a 
	p4l6	barbaric enclosure locally 
	p4l7	entitled a dueling pit. My 
	p4l8	plaintive cries for help 
	p5l1	went unheeded by the 
	p5l2	guards, for the 
	p5l3	inhabitants of Jhelom are 
	p5l4	eager indeed to measure 
	p5l5	fighting prowess at any 
	p5l6	time!
	p5l7	What saved me was the 
	p5l8	ability to improvise a 
	p6l1	melody and tune that 
	p6l2	satirized the proceedings, 
	p6l3	and sufficiently angered 
	p6l4	an onlooker to prod him 
	p6l5	to coming to my defense. 
	p6l6	Once that fight was 
	p6l7	underway I was able to 
	p6l8	make good my escape. 
	p7l1	Hence, I regard the 
	p7l2	ability to incite fights as 
	p7l3	indispensable to the 
	p7l4	prudent bard.
	p7l5	Upon another occasion, 
	p7l6	’twas the obverse side 
	p7l7	of that coin which saved 
	p7l8	me for I was being held 
	p8l1	prisoner by a particularly 
	p8l2	nasty band of ruffians 
	p8l3	who had seized me 
	p8l4	unawares from the road 
	p8l5	to Vesper.
	p8l6	They had worked 
	p8l7	themselves into a frenzy 
	p8l8	and were ready to attack 
	p9l1	and I fear, tear me limb 
	p9l2	from limb, when I began 
	p9l3	to sing frantically, tapping 
	p9l4	my fallen drum wit my 
	p9l5	tied up feet. The melody 
	p9l6	developed into a soothing 
	p9l7	one, and the brigands 
	p9l8	slowly calmed down to the 
	p10l1	extent of apologizing, and 
	p10l2	they let me go!
	p10l3	A final example I would 
	p10l4	pray you grant your 
	p10l5	attention: once I was lost 
	p10l6	upon a large isle far to 
	p10l7	the east of the mainland, 
	p10l8	well beyond Serpent’s 
	p11l1	Hold, where lava made its 
	p11l2	sluggish way across the 
	p11l3	surface landscape. And 
	p11l4	this accursed land was 
	p11l5	filled with vile beats and 
	p11l6	cunning dragons.
	p11l7	I was being pursued by 
	p11l8	one of said fell dragons 
	p12l1	when I found myself 
	p12l2	trapped. I quickly skirted 
	p12l3	a bubbling pool of molten 
	p12l4	rock and attempted to 
	p12l5	hide. The dragon scented 
	p12l6	me and was preparing to 
	p12l7	skirt the pool, when I 
	p12l8	began to play a lusty 
	p13l1	tune upon my lute that 
	p13l2	attracted its attention. 
	p13l3	Mesmerized and enticed 
	p13l4	by the melody, it stepped 
	p13l5	directly towards me, and 
	p13l6	into the lava-where its 
	p13l7	foot was so burned that 
	p13l8	it quickly hopped away, 
	p14l1	undignified and annoyed.
	p14l2	
	p14l3	‘Tis my fond hope that 
	p14l4	other travelling minstrels 
	p14l5	shall learn from my 
	p14l6	experience and apply 
	p14l7	themselves to practicing 
	p14l8	these skills in order to 
	p15l1	preserve life and limb.

	title	Trade Associations
	author	Pieter of Vesper
	p1l1	The Major Trade 
	p1l2	Associations
	p1l3	
	p1l4	There are ten major 
	p1l5	trade associations that 
	p1l6	operate legitimately in the 
	p1l7	lands of Britannia and 
	p1l8	among its trading 
	p2l1	partners. Many of these 
	p2l2	guilds are divided into 
	p2l3	local or specialty 
	p2l4	subguilds, who use the 
	p2l5	same colors but vary the 
	p2l6	heraldic pattern. There 
	p2l7	are many lesser trade 
	p2l8	associations that have 
	p3l1	closed membership, and 
	p3l2	one can join only by 
	p3l3	invitation. “Beltran's 
	p3l4	Guide to the Guild"” is 
	p3l5	the definitive text on the 
	p3l6	fulll range of guilds and 
	p3l7	other associations in 
	p3l8	Britannia, and I heartily 
	p4l1	recommend it.
	p4l2	
	p4l3	In what follows I have 
	p4l4	attempted to bring 
	p4l5	together the known 
	p4l6	information regarding 
	p4l7	these guilds. I offer thee 
	p4l8	the name, typical 
	p5l1	membership, heraldic 
	p5l2	colors, known specialty 
	p5l3	organizaitons within the 
	p5l4	larger guild, and any 
	p5l5	known affiliations to 
	p5l6	other guilds, which often 
	p5l7	occur because of trade 
	p5l8	reasons.

	p2l4	Today, Thomas died. I am 
	p2l5	still horrified by how he 
	p2l6	was tortured, as I believe 
	p2l7	the boy was innocent. I 
	p2l8	am compelled to write 
	p3l1	down his story so that I 
	p3l2	might clear his name once 
	p3l3	I'm released from this 
	p3l4	hell. What follows is 
	p3l5	Thomas' Story.
	p3l6	
	p3l7	The badly beaten shell of 
	p3l8	a boy shackled to the 
	p4l1	wall of this cell is all 
	p4l2	that remains of Thomas, 
	p4l3	who was convicted of the 
	p4l4	murder of a young girl 
	p4l5	he was in love with, Nina. 
	p4l6	Being of the same age 
	p4l7	and the only children of 
	p4l8	neighboring farm houses, 
	p5l1	they were practically 
	p5l2	inseparable growing up; it 
	p5l3	was a common sight to 
	p5l4	see them playing in the 
	p5l5	fields, playing pranks on 
	p5l6	the field hands, and in 
	p5l7	later years, walking hand 
	p5l8	in hand as they returned 
	p6l1	home at the end of each 
	p6l2	day's labors. It was 
	p6l3	commonly known that they 
	p6l4	would marry as soon as 
	p6l5	they both reached 
	p6l6	adulthood, so it was in 
	p6l7	the midst of wedding 
	p6l8	preparations that Nina 
	p7l1	was found slain, her body 
	p7l2	beaten and bloodied, yet 
	p7l3	strangely arranged as if 
	p7l4	in a peaceful slumber.
	p7l5	
	p7l6	The village was shocked, 
	p7l7	and the hunt for the 
	p7l8	murderer began at once. 
	p8l1	No one knew if it was a 
	p8l2	drunken jailor from the 
	p8l3	drunken jailor from the a 
	p8l4	wandering brigand who 
	p8l5	happened upon her alone 
	p8l6	that night. The sheriff 
	p8l7	thought that the murder 
	p8l8	scene pointed towards a 
	p9l1	violent outburst, followed 
	p9l2	by regret, for what kind 
	p9l3	of criminal would beat a 
	p9l4	young girl to death and 
	p9l5	then take the time to 
	p9l6	lay her body in a position 
	p9l7	of rest?
	p9l8	
	p10l1	The village was shocked, 
	p10l2	and the hunt for the 
	p10l3	murderer began at once. 
	p10l4	No one knew if it was a 
	p10l5	drunken jailor from the 
	p10l6	drunken jailor from the a 
	p10l7	wandering brigand who 
	p10l8	happened upon her alone 
	p11l1	that night. The sheriff 
	p11l2	thought that the murder 
	p11l3	scene pointed towards a 
	p11l4	violent outburst, followed 
	p11l5	by regret, for what kind 
	p11l6	of criminal would beat a 
	p11l7	young girl to death and 
	p11l8	then take the time to 
	p12l1	lay her body in a position 
	p12l2	of rest?
	p12l3	
	p12l4	A week later, with Nina 
	p12l5	buried in the ground and 
	p12l6	her mother bed-ridden in 
	p12l7	shock, the local constable 
	p12l8	enlisted the aid of every 
	p13l1	available person, which 
	p13l2	included any off-duty 
	p13l3	staff from the prison. 
	p13l4	The countryside was 
	p13l5	scoured, the hunting dogs 
	p13l6	released, but no sign of 
	p13l7	unaccounted for travelers 
	p13l8	could be found. The prison 
	p14l1	guards were all working 
	p14l2	that night or in the 
	p14l3	village tavern. Hope 
	p14l4	amongst the townsfolk 
	p14l5	that the murderer would 
	p14l6	be brought to justice 
	p14l7	was fading as fast as 
	p14l8	their anger was rising. It 
	p15l1	was in this atmosphere 
	p15l2	that an unlikely detective, 
	p15l3	the head executioner of 
	p15l4	the prison, claimed to 
	p15l5	find a big of bloody cloth 
	p15l6	in the field where Nina's 
	p15l7	body was found. The cloth 
	p15l8	had 'to my beloved 
	p16l1	Thomas' inscribed on it.
	p16l2	
	p16l3	This cloth was immediately 
	p16l4	recognized as belonging to 
	p16l5	a scarf Nina had woven 
	p16l6	for Thomas, and a hasty 
	p16l7	search of his room found 
	p16l8	the rest of the bloodied 
	p17l1	and torn scarf hidden 
	p17l2	under his straw sleeping 
	p17l3	mat. The village was 
	p17l4	shocked, because no one 
	p17l5	had suspected Thomas, 
	p17l6	but when the head 
	p17l7	executioner produced a 
	p17l8	guard willing to testify 
	p18l1	that he had overheard 
	p18l2	Nina telling Thomas that 
	p18l3	she had fallen in love 
	p18l4	with another boy just 
	p18l5	days before the body was 
	p18l6	found.
	p18l7	
	p18l8	
	p19l1	In their righteous anger, 
	p19l2	the villagers were quick 
	p19l3	to condemn. Despite 
	p19l4	Thomas' tearful protests 
	p19l5	of innocence, and his 
	p19l6	claim that the scarf had 
	p19l7	been lost sometime after 
	p19l8	the murder, no one 
	p20l1	bothered to question the 
	p20l2	source of the 'evidence'. 
	p20l3	Thomas was pronounced 
	p20l4	guilty, and immediately 
	p20l5	chained and sent to the 
	p20l6	prison to await his 
	p20l7	execution. That was the 
	p20l8	last that Thomas' family 
	p21l1	ever saw of him. The 
	p21l2	village folk, used to a 
	p21l3	hardscrabbled life, soon 
	p21l4	forgot him as they 
	p21l5	turned their attention 
	p21l6	back towards feeding 
	p21l7	their families and 
	p21l8	surviving the coming 
	p22l1	winter this far in the 
	p22l2	North.
	p22l3	
	p22l4	It was during his last 
	p22l5	days of life in the prison 
	p22l6	that Thomas learned the 
	p22l7	fate of his beloved Nina, 
	p22l8	for it was the head 
	p23l1	executioner himself behind 
	p23l2	the deed. It seems that 
	p23l3	he had lusted after the 
	p23l4	beautiful young Nina for 
	p23l5	years; with the wedding 
	p23l6	coming soon and her 
	p23l7	innocence soon to be lost, 
	p23l8	the executioner followed 
	p24l1	her out into the fields 
	p24l2	with delusions of seducing 
	p24l3	the inexperienced girl with 
	p24l4	ease. Of course, she 
	p24l5	would have nothing to do 
	p24l6	with him and fought off 
	p24l7	his advances. The 
	p24l8	executioner, not at all 
	p25l1	expecting to be rejected, 
	p25l2	and knowing that the 
	p25l3	feisty young girl would 
	p25l4	hardly stay silent about 
	p25l5	the night's events, 
	p25l6	became very angry and 
	p25l7	afraid.
	p25l8	
	p26l1	As he beat her 
	p26l2	mercilessly, just before 
	p26l3	she was lost to this 
	p26l4	world, a single tear 
	p26l5	streamed down her cheek, 
	p26l6	for she knew that she 
	p26l7	would never against set 
	p26l8	her eyes upon her true 
	p27l1	love. It was with that 
	p27l2	final bittersweet thought 
	p27l3	that she slipped into 
	p27l4	unconsciousness under the 
	p27l5	heavy rain of blows.
	p27l6	
	p27l7	The deed complete, the 
	p27l8	executioner's anger 
	p28l1	subsided. Far from being 
	p28l2	a dullard, he knew that 
	p28l3	he needed to frame 
	p28l4	someone else for his act. 
	p28l5	Who else but the pretty 
	p28l6	boy Thomas with his 
	p28l7	ever-present smirk?
	p28l8	
	p29l1	Quickly putting together a 
	p29l2	plan, the executioner 
	p29l3	arranged Nina's body as 
	p29l4	if he actually cared for 
	p29l5	the girl, which of course, 
	p29l6	he did not. Later, during 
	p29l7	the initial search when 
	p29l8	the townsfolk were 
	p30l1	searching far and wide, 
	p30l2	he snuck into Thomas' 
	p30l3	house with a pouch of 
	p30l4	sheeps blood. Splattering 
	p30l5	the scarf with the blood, 
	p30l6	he then tore off a piece 
	p30l7	and slid the scarf 
	p30l8	underneath Thomas' 
	p31l1	sleeping matt. He then 
	p31l2	slipped back out unnoticed, 
	p31l3	and thus was successful 
	p31l4	at planting the 
	p31l5	'evidence' that would 
	p31l6	divert any suspicion from 
	p31l7	himself onto Thomas. Half 
	p31l8	threatening and half 
	p32l1	bribing one of the 
	p32l2	corrupt prison guards into 
	p32l3	bearing false witness and 
	p32l4	then claiming to find the 
	p32l5	bloodied scrap of cloth 
	p32l6	were the easiest parts 
	p32l7	of his plan.
	p32l8	
	p33l1	Then it was just a 
	p33l2	matter of waiting for 
	p33l3	the farce of a trial to 
	p33l4	finish, and Thomas was 
	p33l5	delivered to the 
	p33l6	executioner to do with as 
	p33l7	he pleased. And did it 
	p33l8	ever please him greatly 
	p34l1	to torture the boy for 
	p34l2	many hours on end, telling 
	p34l3	him lies too, mostly about 
	p34l4	his beloved Nina being 
	p34l5	unfaithful at the end. 
	p34l6	While I think that deep 
	p34l7	down a part of Thomas 
	p34l8	never believed them, the 
	p35l1	pain and suffering left 
	p35l2	him in a delusional state 
	p35l3	of mind, and he spend his 
	p35l4	last days crying out in 
	p35l5	pain, asking the memory 
	p35l6	of Nina why she had 
	p35l7	betrayed him so, and 
	p35l8	finally just sobbing until 
	p36l1	his spirit let go of life 
	p36l2	and death overcame him. 
	p36l3	The executioner's hatred 
	p36l4	was so great that 
	p36l5	Thomas was left to rot 
	p36l6	shackled to this wall, and 
	p36l7	great injustice done to 
	p36l8	the boy both in life and 
	p37l1	in death.

	title	Girl of the Forest
	author	Horace, trader
	p1l1	The Wild Girl of the 
	p1l2	Forest
	p1l3	Her name was Leyla, she 
	p1l4	said, and her hair was 
	p1l5	braided wild with creepers 
	p1l6	and thorns. I marveled 
	p1l7	that they did not hurt 
	p1l8	her, but when I asked, 
	p2l1	she but shrugged and let 
	p2l2	her eyes roam once more 
	p2l3	across the woods. Though 
	p2l4	I had my hands securely 
	p2l5	fastened by her ropes, I 
	p2l6	itched to reach out and 
	p2l7	comb that unruly golden 
	p2l8	mane, dirtied and 
	p3l1	leaf-ridden.
	p3l2	
	p3l3	Her provenance, she told 
	p3l4	me over nights illuminated 
	p3l5	by campfires, was once 
	p3l6	the city of Trinsic. She 
	p3l7	claimed to have been 
	p3l8	kidnapped and raised by 
	p4l1	orcs, which I judged an 
	p4l2	unlikely tale, for all know 
	p4l3	orcs delight in eating the 
	p4l4	meat of honest folk. 
	p4l5	When I told her this, she 
	p4l6	laughed a fey laugh, and 
	p4l7	gaily admitted that honest 
	p4l8	she was not, for oft had 
	p5l1	she stolen folk away 
	p5l2	from caravans to loot 
	p5l3	their possessions from an 
	p5l4	unconscious body!
	p5l5	At this, I began to fear 
	p5l6	for my life, and her 
	p5l7	smile seemed full of 
	p5l8	teeth sharper than a 
	p6l1	human ought to have, for 
	p6l2	the tale of orcish raising 
	p6l3	had struck fear into the 
	p6l4	marrow of my bones. 
	p6l5	“Wil thou eat me?” I 
	p6l6	asked, a-tremble, fearing 
	p6l7	the answer.
	p6l8	And she cocked her head 
	p7l1	at me, like a wild animal 
	p7l2	facing a word that it 
	p7l3	dost not understand, and 
	p7l4	the fixity in her eyes 
	p7l5	was a glimpse into the 
	p7l6	deeper reaches of the 
	p7l7	Abyss. But she finally 
	p7l8	grunted, and said “Nay,” 
	p8l1	in a voice that recalled 
	p8l2	to me a child. “Nay,” 
	p8l3	she said, “for thou dost 
	p8l4	remind me of a boy I 
	p8l5	knew once, when I was a 
	p8l6	girl who played in a city 
	p8l7	of great sandstone walls, 
	p8l8	before I was taken. He 
	p9l1	had sandy hair like thee, 
	p9l2	and I dreamt as a child 
	p9l3	of holding his hand and 
	p9l4	sharing flavored ice. His 
	p9l5	name was Japheth.
	p9l6	The next morning she let 
	p9l7	me go, stripped of my 
	p9l8	pouch and clothes, and 
	p10l1	bade me run through the 
	p10l2	woods, and to fear 
	p10l3	recapture, for surely her 
	p10l4	heart would not soften 
	p10l5	again. ‘Twas a fearful 
	p10l6	run, and I came to the 
	p10l7	road to Yew with welts 
	p10l8	and scratches run 
	p11l1	rampant crost my skin, 
	p11l2	but I did not see her 
	p11l3	again.
	p11l4	Oft have I wondered of 
	p11l5	the boy named Japheth, 
	p11l6	and whether he 
	p11l7	remembers a girl who 
	p11l8	lived in sandstone walls. 
	p12l1	The only Japheth I know 
	p12l2	is the Guildmaster of 
	p12l3	Paladins who died last 
	p12l4	year warring amidst the 
	p12l5	orcs, and though he had 
	p12l6	indeed sandy hair, I 
	p12l7	cannot picture him side 
	p12l8	by side with a feral girl 
	p13l1	whose tongue has tasted 
	p13l2	of human flesh. Yet the 
	p13l3	paths of fate are 
	p13l4	strange indeed, and I 
	p13l5	suppose ’tis possible that 
	p13l6	this paladin died defending 
	p13l7	his remembered lady’s 
	p13l8	honor, unknowingly struck 
	p14l1	down by the orc that she 
	p14l2	called father.

	author	Velis, translator
	p1l1	This text has been 
	p1l2	translated from a 
	p1l3	gargoyle’s journal 
	p1l4	following his capture and 
	p1l5	subsequent reeducation – 
	p1l6	Velis
	p1l7	
	p1l8	I write this in the hopes 
	p2l1	that someday a soul of 
	p2l2	pure heart and mind will 
	p2l3	read it. We are not the 
	p2l4	evil beings that our 
	p2l5	cousin gargoyles have 
	p2l6	made us out to be. We 
	p2l7	consider them uncivilized 
	p2l8	and they have no concept 
	p3l1	of the Principles. To you 
	p3l2	who read this, I beg for 
	p3l3	your help in saving my 
	p3l4	brethren and preserving 
	p3l5	my race. We stand at 
	p3l6	the edge of destruction 
	p3l7	as does the rest of the 
	p3l8	world. Once it was 
	p4l1	written law that we 
	p4l2	would not allow the 
	p4l3	knowledge of our 
	p4l4	civilization to spread into 
	p4l5	the world, now we are 
	p4l6	left with little 
	p4l7	choice…contact the 
	p4l8	outside world in the 
	p5l1	hopes of finding help to 
	p5l2	save it or becoming the 
	p5l3	unwilling bringers of its 
	p5l4	damnation. I fear my 
	p5l5	capture is certain, the 
	p5l6	controllers grow ever 
	p5l7	closer to my hiding place 
	p5l8	and I know if they 
	p6l1	discover me, my fate will 
	p6l2	be as that of my 
	p6l3	brothers. Although we 
	p6l4	resisted with all our 
	p6l5	strength, it is now clear 
	p6l6	that we must have 
	p6l7	assistance or our people 
	p6l8	will be gone. And if our 
	p7l1	oppressor achieves his 
	p7l2	goals our race will surely 
	p7l3	be joined by others. 
	p7l4	
	p7l5	Those of us who have 
	p7l6	not yet been taken hope 
	p7l7	to open a path from the 
	p7l8	outside world into the 
	p8l1	city. We believe we have 
	p8l2	found weak areas in the 
	p8l3	mountains that we can 
	p8l4	successfully knock through 
	p8l5	with our limited supplies. 
	p8l6	We will have to work 
	p8l7	quickly and the risk of 
	p8l8	being discovered is great, 
	p9l1	but no choice remains...

	title	Treatise on Alchemy
	author	Felicia Hierophant
	p1l1	The alchemical arts are 
	p1l2	notable for their 
	p1l3	deceptive simplicity. ‘Tis 
	p1l4	true that to our best 
	p1l5	knowledge currently, there 
	p1l6	are but eight valid 
	p1l7	potions that can be made 
	p1l8	(though I emphasize that 
	p2l1	new discoveries may 
	p2l2	always await). However, 
	p2l3	the delicate balance of 
	p2l4	confecting the potions is 
	p2l5	difficult indeed, and 
	p2l6	requires great skill.
	p2l7	
	p2l8	To give thee an example 
	p3l1	of the simpler potions 
	p3l2	that can be created by 
	p3l3	those well-versed in the 
	p3l4	subtleties of alchemy.
	p3l5	
	p3l6	Black pearl, that rare 
	p3l7	substance that is oft 
	p3l8	found lying unannounced 
	p4l1	upon the surface of the 
	p4l2	ground, when properly 
	p4l3	crushed with mortar and 
	p4l4	pestle, can yield a fine 
	p4l5	powder. Said powder in 
	p4l6	the proper proportions 
	p4l7	when mixed via the 
	p4l8	alchemical arts can yield 
	p5l1	a wonderfully refreshing 
	p5l2	drink.
	p5l3	
	p5l4	The revolting blood moss 
	p5l5	so gingerly scraped off 
	p5l6	windowsills by fastidious 
	p5l7	housewives is but a tiny 
	p5l8	cousin to the wilder 
	p6l1	version, which when 
	p6l2	properly prepared yields a 
	p6l3	magical liquid that for a 
	p6l4	time can make the 
	p6l5	imbiber a more agile and 
	p6l6	dextrous individual.
	p6l7	
	p6l8	However, beware of the 
	p7l1	deadly nightshade, for it 
	p7l2	yields a deceptively 
	p7l3	sweet-tasting poison that 
	p7l4	can prove highly fatal to 
	p7l5	the drinker, and in fact 
	p7l6	is also used by assassins 
	p7l7	to coat their blades. 
	p7l8	Fortunately, this latter 
	p8l1	art of poisoning is little 
	p8l2	known!
	p8l3	
	p8l4	There is much to reward 
	p8l5	the student of alchemy, 
	p8l6	indeed. The rumors of 
	p8l7	longtime alchemists losing 
	p8l8	their hair and acquiring 
	p9l1	an unhealthy pallor, not 
	p9l2	to mention unsightly 
	p9l3	blotches upon their 
	p9l4	once-fair skin, are 
	p9l5	unhappily, true. Yet the 
	p9l6	joys of the mind make 
	p9l7	up for the complete loss 
	p9l8	of interest that others 
	p10l1	may have in thee as an 
	p10l2	object of courtship, and I 
	p10l3	have never regretted that 
	p10l4	choice. Honestly, truly. 
	p10l5	Not once.

	title	Virtues
	author	Lord British
	p1l1	Within this world live 
	p1l2	people with many 
	p1l3	different ideals, and this 
	p1l4	is good. Yet what is it 
	p1l5	within the people of our 
	p1l6	land that sorts out the 
	p1l7	good from the evil, the 
	p1l8	cherished form the 
	p2l1	disdained? Virtue, I say it 
	p2l2	is, and virtue is the 
	p2l3	logical outcome of a 
	p2l4	people who wish to live 
	p2l5	together in a bonded 
	p2l6	society.
	p2l7	
	p2l8	For without Virtues as a 
	p3l1	code of conduct which 
	p3l2	people maintai(n) in their 
	p3l3	relations with each other, 
	p3l4	the fabric of that 
	p3l5	society will become 
	p3l6	weakene(d.) For a society 
	p3l7	to grow and prosper for 
	p3l8	all, each must grant the 
	p4l1	others a common base of 
	p4l2	consideration.
	p4l3	
	p4l4	I call this base the 
	p4l5	Virtues. For though one 
	p4l6	person might gain personal 
	p4l7	advantage by breaching 
	p4l8	such a code, the society 
	p5l1	as a whole would suffer.
	p5l2	
	p5l3	There are three Principle 
	p5l4	Virtues tha(t) should 
	p5l5	guide people to 
	p5l6	enlightenment. These are: 
	p5l7	Truth, Love, and Courage. 
	p5l8	From all the infinite 
	p6l1	reasons one may have to 
	p6l2	found an action, such as 
	p6l3	greed or charity, envy or 
	p6l4	pity, the three Principle 
	p6l5	Virtues stand out.
	p6l6	
	p6l7	In fact all other virtues 
	p6l8	and vices can be show(n) 
	p7l1	to be built from these 
	p7l2	principle(s) and their 
	p7l3	opposite corruption’s of 
	p7l4	Falsehood, Hatred an(d) 
	p7l5	Cowardice. These three 
	p7l6	Principles can be combined 
	p7l7	in eight ways, which I will 
	p7l8	call the eight virtues. The 
	p8l1	eight virtues which we 
	p8l2	should build our society 
	p8l3	upon follow.
	p8l4	
	p8l5	Truth alone becomes 
	p8l6	Honesty, for without 
	p8l7	honesty between our 
	p8l8	people, how can we build 
	p9l1	the trust which is needed 
	p9l2	to maximize our 
	p9l3	successes.
	p9l4	
	p9l5	Love alone becomes 
	p9l6	compassion, for at some 
	p9l7	time or another all of us 
	p9l8	will need the compassion 
	p10l1	of others, and most likely 
	p10l2	compassion will be shown 
	p10l3	to those who have shown 
	p10l4	it.
	p10l5	
	p10l6	Courage alone becomes 
	p10l7	Valor, without valor our 
	p10l8	people will never reach 
	p11l1	into the unknown or to 
	p11l2	the risky and will never 
	p11l3	achieve.
	p11l4	
	p11l5	Truth tempered by Love 
	p11l6	gives us Justice, for only 
	p11l7	in loving search for the 
	p11l8	truth can one dispense 
	p12l1	fair Justice, rather than 
	p12l2	create a cold and callous 
	p12l3	people.
	p12l4	
	p12l5	Love and Courage gives 
	p12l6	us Sacrifice, for a people 
	p12l7	who love each other will 
	p12l8	be willing to make 
	p13l1	personal sacrifices to help 
	p13l2	others in need, which one 
	p13l3	day, may be needed in 
	p13l4	return.
	p13l5	
	p13l6	Courage and Truth give 
	p13l7	us Honor, great knights 
	p13l8	know this well, that 
	p14l1	chivalric honor can be 
	p14l2	found by adhering to this 
	p14l3	code of conduct.
	p14l4	
	p14l5	Combining Truth, Love and 
	p14l6	Courage suggest the 
	p14l7	virtue of Spirituality the 
	p14l8	virtu(e) that causes one 
	p15l1	to be introspective, to 
	p15l2	wonder about ones place 
	p15l3	in this world and whether 
	p15l4	one’s deeds will be 
	p15l5	recorded as a gift to 
	p15l6	the world or a plague.
	p15l7	
	p15l8	
	p16l1	The final Virtue is more 
	p16l2	complicated. For the 
	p16l3	eighth combination is that 
	p16l4	devoid of Truth, Love or 
	p16l5	Courage which can only 
	p16l6	exist in a state of great 
	p16l7	Pride, whic(h) of course 
	p16l8	is not a virtue at all. 
	p17l1	Perhaps this trick of 
	p17l2	fate is a test to see if 
	p17l3	one can realize that the 
	p17l4	true virtue is that of 
	p17l5	Humility. I feel that the 
	p17l6	people of Magincia fail to 
	p17l7	see this to such a 
	p17l8	degree that I would not 
	p18l1	be surprised if some ill 
	p18l2	fate awaited their future.
	p18l3	
	p18l4	Thus from the infinite 
	p18l5	possibilities which spawned 
	p18l6	the Three Principles of 
	p18l7	Truth, Love and Courage, 
	p18l8	come the Eight Virtues 
	p19l1	of Honesty, Compassion, 
	p19l2	Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, 
	p19l3	Honor, Spirituality, and 
	p19l4	Humility.

	p5l5	personal opinion, but it 
	p5l6	wasn' me what named it.
	p5l7	
	p5l8	Blue grouper:
	p6l1	
	p6l2	These be uncommon 
	p6l3	because most fishermen 
	p6l4	mistake them for other 
	p6l5	fish 'cause they ain't 
	p6l6	actually blue. This be thar 
	p6l7	natural defense.
	p6l8	
	p7l1	Bluefish:
	p7l2	
	p7l3	If ye be trying ta 
	p7l4	remember where to fish 
	p7l5	for bluefish, jus' 
	p7l6	remember the big blue 
	p7l7	spot on their fin that 
	p7l8	looks like a ship.
	p8l1	
	p8l2	Bonefish:
	p8l3	
	p8l4	This fish be havin lots o' 
	p8l5	bones. Like double the 
	p8l6	normal amount. I seen 
	p8l7	some that couldn't even 
	p8l8	move!
	p9l1	
	p9l2	Bonito:
	p9l3	
	p9l4	Bonito be great when 
	p9l5	smoked and dried. Tis a 
	p9l6	favorite of Tokuno.
	p9l7	
	p9l8	Cape cod:
	p10l1	
	p10l2	This fish be found off 
	p10l3	the cape. Way off the 
	p10l4	cape. Like in the middle 
	p10l5	o' the sea.
	p10l6	
	p10l7	
	p10l8	Captain snook:
	p11l1	
	p11l2	Whatever sun baked swab 
	p11l3	named this poor devil 
	p11l4	cap'n snook should be keel 
	p11l5	hauled!  I knew Cap'n 
	p11l6	Snook, this be no Cap'n 
	p11l7	Snook.
	p11l8	
	p12l1	Cobia:
	p12l2	
	p12l3	Best to not be confusin' 
	p12l4	the cobia with the cobra, 
	p12l5	the cobra be requiring a 
	p12l6	totally different kind o' 
	p12l7	bait.
	p12l8	
	p13l1	Gray snapper:
	p13l2	
	p13l3	Old sailors say that many 
	p13l4	generations ago the gray 
	p13l5	snapper used to be the 
	p13l6	blonde snapper.
	p13l7	
	p13l8	Haddock:
	p14l1	
	p14l2	When tha' wind's in yar 
	p14l3	hair, the salt's on yar 
	p14l4	lips and yar hook's 
	p14l5	wrapped around yar pole, 
	p14l6	the haddock be thar.
	p14l7	
	p14l8	Mahi mahi:
	p15l1	
	p15l2	They say the most 
	p15l3	persuasive argument is 
	p15l4	repetition.  This might 
	p15l5	explain why mahi mahi be 
	p15l6	so popular.
	p15l7	
	p15l8	Red drum:
	p16l1	
	p16l2	The red drum is thus 
	p16l3	named because o' the 
	p16l4	sound it makes when you 
	p16l5	thump it on the head.
	p16l6	Red grouper:
	p16l7	
	p16l8	Red grouper be extra 
	p17l1	good with a dolop o'

	p18l4	
	p18l5	The shad be one o' me 
	p18l6	personal favorite deep see 
	p18l7	uncommon fish.
	p18l8	
	p19l1	Tarpon:
	p19l2	
	p19l3	This fella once told me 
	p19l4	the word ‘Tarpon' be 
	p19l5	derived from the word 
	p19l6	‘Tarpaulin' but I's 
	p19l7	pretty sure he was 
	p19l8	insane.
	p20l1	
	p20l2	Yellowfin tuna:
	p20l3	
	p20l4	The best thing about tuna 
	p20l5	is that it tastes like 
	p20l6	chicken that was eaten 
	p20l7	by a fish.
