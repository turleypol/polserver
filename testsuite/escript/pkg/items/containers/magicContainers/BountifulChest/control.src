/*

*  Bountiful Chest
*  This programme is the controller for a chest that copies
*  an herbal reagent placed into it by a player.
*  The number of copies and the time interval between copies
*  is in the settings file located in /BountifulChest/config
*
*  The custom canInsert programme (script) prevents
*  anything but plant based reagents from being placed
*  in the box. It also prevents a stack of plant based
*  reagents from being placed in the chest.
*
*  The custom onInsert programme only adds the required CProps
*  to items placed in the box by a player.
